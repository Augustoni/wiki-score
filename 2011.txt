It is predicted that future climate changes will include further global warming (i.e., an upward [[trend estimation|trend]] in global mean temperature), sea level rise, and a probable increase in the frequency of some [[extreme weather|extreme weather events]]. Signatories of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] have agreed to implement policies designed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. ==Definition of climate change== {{See also|Attribution of recent climate change}} This article refers to reports produced by the IPCC. In their usage, "climate change" refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties, and that persists for extended periods, typically decades or longer (IPCC, 2007d:30). <ref name=ar4syn>{{cite web |date=2007d |title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current| currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming, with greater temperature increases over land and in [[polar region]]s rather than over the oceans.<ref>{{cite book |author={{harvnb|Staudt|2008}} |page=6}}</ref> Using models, it is possible to identify the human "signal" of global warming over both land and ocean areas. Projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale.<ref>{{cite book |author={{harvnb|Staudt|2008}} |page=9}} </ref> It is, however, expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already, with greatest warming over land and high northern [[latitude]]s, and least over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |contribution=Projections of Future Changes in Climate |series=Summary for Policymakers |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Solomon|2007}} }}</ref> ===Biogeochemical cycles=== {{See also|climate change feedback}} Climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive {{q |feedback}} process. A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process. A positive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it (IPCC, 2007d:78).<ref name = ar4syn /> Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive (Schneider ''et al.'', 2007:792).<ref name=schneider>{{cite book |author=Schneider, SH, ''et al'' |chapter=Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html | publisher = IPCC | place = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|p=781}} }}</ref> Using the A2 SRES emissions scenario, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:789) found that this effect led to additional warming by 2100, relative to the 1990–2000 period, of 0.1–1.5°C. This estimate was made with high confidence. The climate projections made in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report of 1.1–6.4°C account for this feedback effect. On the other hand, with medium confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007) commented that additional releases of GHGs were possible from permafrost, peat lands, wetlands, and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes. ===Glacier retreat and disappearance=== {{Main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}} [[Image:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|width=250px|left|thumb|A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970.

Changes in glaciers and snow cover are expected to reduce water availability for these populations. *In [[Latin America]], changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers will significantly affect water availability for human consumption, agriculture, and energy production. ===Oceans=== The role of the oceans in global warming is a complex one. The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of {{chem|CO|2}} have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess {{chem|CO|2}}. The ocean have also acted as a sink in absorbing extra heat from the atmosphere. This extra heat has been added to the climate system due to the build-up of GHGs. More than 90 percent of warming that occurred over 1960–2009 is estimated to have gone into the oceans.<ref name=statecl> {{cite book | year = 2010 | month = July | publisher = Website of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: National Climatic Data Center | title = State of the Climate in 2009, as appearing in the July 2010 issue (Vol. 91) of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS).

However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. According to Easterling ''et al.'' (2007), [[sub-Saharan Africa]] will likely surpass [[Asia]] as the most food-insecure region. This projection was largely independent of climate change and mostly the result of projected social and economic development. Easterling ''et al.'' (2007) pointed to the large potential benefits of [[climate change mitigation]] (i.e., reducing GHG emissions) on the agriculture sector. It was suggested that these benefits might only become apparent in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref>{{cite book |author=Confalonieri, U. ''et al'' |chapter=Human health |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=391–431}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393), the effects of climate change to date have been small, but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions. With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that climate change had altered the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species. With medium confidence, they concluded that climate change had: *altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors *increased heatwave-related deaths With high confidence, IPCC (2007d:48) projected that:<ref name=ar4syn/> *the health status of millions of people would be affected through, for example, increases in [[malnutrition]]; increased deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; increased burden of [[Diarrhea|diarrhoeal disease]]s; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to high concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change; and altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases. *climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in Africa. Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure. ====Specific health impacts==== {{POV-section|date=May 2010|Malaria}} {{Cleanup split|Climate change, industry and society|date=May 2010}} '''Malnutrition''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

Projected relative risks attributable to climate change in 2030 varied by health outcome and region. Risks were largely negative, with most of the projected disease burden due to increases in diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition. These increases were primarily in low-income populations already experiencing a large burden of disease. '''Extreme events''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

The impacts of weather disasters is considerable and unequally distributed. For example, natural disasters have been shown to result in increased domestic violence against - and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorders]] in – [[women]]. In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors. High-density populations in low-lying coastal regions experience a high health burden from weather disasters. ''Heatwaves'' Hot days, hot nights and heatwaves have become more frequent (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-1.html "8.2.1.1 Heatwaves"]</ref> Heatwaves are associated with marked short-term increases in mortality. For example, in August 2003, a heatwave in Europe resulted in excess mortality in the range of 35,000 total deaths. Heat-related morbidity and mortality is projected to increase (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-3.html "8.4.1.3 Heat- and cold-related mortality"]</ref> The health burden could be relatively small for moderate heatwaves in temperate regions, because deaths occur primarily in susceptible persons. ''Drought'' The effects of drought on health include deaths, malnutrition, [[infectious disease]]s and [[respiratory disease]]s (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s823/> Countries within the "[[Meningitis]] Belt" in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]] and [[epidemic]] frequency of [[meningococcal disease|meningococcal]] meningitis in Africa, although other areas in the Rift Valley, the Great Lakes, and southern Africa are also affected (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-3-1.html "8.2.3.1 Drought and infectious disease"]</ref> The spatial distribution, intensity, and seasonality of meningococcal (epidemic) meningitis appear to be strongly linked to climate and environmental factors, particularly drought.

(2007) concluded that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases.<ref name=wg2c8es/> Childhood mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains high (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-5.html "8.2.5 Water and disease"]</ref> This is despite improvements in care. Several studies have shown that transmission of [[intestine|enteric]] pathogens is higher during the rainy season. Some studies have found that higher temperature was strongly associated with increased episodes of diarrhoeal disease in adults and children in Peru. The WHO study, referred to earlier, projected that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income regions by approximately 2 to 5% in 2020 (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8411/> '''Ground-level ozone''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality associated with ground-level [[ozone]].<ref name=wg2c8es/> Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and is the primary constituent of urban [[smog]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-6.html "8.2.6 Air quality and disease"]</ref> Ozone in smog is formed through chemical reactions involving [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other compounds. The reaction is a [[photochemical reaction]], meaning that it involves [[electromagnetic radiation]], and occurs in the presence of bright sunshine and high temperatures. Exposure to elevated concentrations of ozone is associated with increased hospital admissions for [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], allergic [[rhinitis]] and other respiratory diseases, and with premature mortality. Background levels of ground-level ozone have risen since pre-industrial times because of increasing emissions of methane, [[carbon monoxide]] and nitrogen oxides (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-4.html "8.4.1.4 Urban air quality"]</ref> This trend is expected to continue into the mid-21<sup>st</sup> century. '''Cold-waves''' It is expected that<sup>b</sup> climate change will bring some health benefits (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> It is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by negative climate change effects. [[cold wave|Cold-waves]] continue to be a problem in northern latitudes, where very low temperatures can be reached in a few hours and extend over long periods (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-2.html "8.2.1.2 Cold-waves"]</ref> Reductions in cold-deaths due to climate change are projected to be greater than increases in heat-related deaths in the UK (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413/> [[Image:NOAAprecipitationtrend.jpg|thumb|right|Precipitation during the 20th century and up through 2008 during global warming, the [[NOAA]] estimating an observed trend over that period of 1.87% global precipitation increase per century.]] ===Water resources=== {{See also|Water crisis}} In a literature assessment, Kundzewicz ''et al.'' (2007:175) concluded, with high confidence, that:<ref>{{cite book |author=Kundzewicz ZW ''et al'' |chapter=Freshwater resources and their management |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch3.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=173–210}} }}</ref> *the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. All of the regions assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic), and small islands) showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. *Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater. With very high confidence, it was judged that many of these areas, e.g., the Mediterranean basin, western USA, southern Africa, and north-eastern Brazil, would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. ===Migration and conflict=== An argument can be made that rising ethnic conflicts may be linked to competition over natural resources that are increasingly scarce as a result of climate change (Wilbanks ''et al.'', 2007:365).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wilbanks, TJ ''et al'' |chapter=Industry, settlement and society |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch7.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=357–90}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Wilbanks ''et al.'' (2007:365), other factors need to be taken into account. It was suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa have more to do with the relative abundance of resources, e.g., oil and diamonds, than with resource scarcity. On this basis, Wilbanks ''et al.'' (2007:365) suggested that predictions of future conflicts due climate change should be viewed with caution. With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:787) predicted that stresses such as increased drought, water shortages, and riverine and coastal flooding would affect many local and regional populations.<ref name = schneider /> With medium confidence, it was predicted that these stresses would lead, in some cases, to relocation within or between countries. This might have the effect of exacerbating conflicts, and possibly impose migration pressures. Zhang ''et al.'' also concluded that climate change drives conflict.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0703073104}}</ref> ===Aggregate impacts=== {{Main|Economic impacts of climate change}} Aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007d:76).<ref name= ar4syn /> The impacts of climate change across world population will not be distributed evenly (Smith ''et al.'', 2001:957).<ref>{{cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Vulnerability to Climate Change and Reasons for Concern: A Synthesis. |title=Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

According to the IPCC (2007b:17), a temperature increase of greater than about 2–3°C would very likely result in all regions either experiencing reductions in net benefits or increases in net costs. ==Regions== Some regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change (IPCC, 2007d:9):<ref name=ar4syn/> *The Arctic, because of high rates of projected warming. *Africa, especially in the sub-Saharan region. This is due to the continent's low capacity to adapt to climate change and projected impacts. *Small islands, due to high exposure of population and infrastructure at risk to sea-level rise and increased storm surge. *Asian megadeltas, due to large populations and high exposure to sea-level rise, storm surge and river flooding. Within other areas, some people are particularly at risk, such as the poor, young children and the elderly. ==Biological systems== {{Main|Climate change and ecosystems}} {{See also|Extinction risk from global warming|Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity|Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals|Effects of climate change on marine mammals}} With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:792) concluded that regional temperature trends were already affecting species and ecosystems around the world.<ref name=schneider/> In a literature assessment, Rosenzweig ''et al.'' (2007:81) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernable influence on many physical and biological systems.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rosenzweig, C ''et al'' |chapter=Assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch1.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=79–131}} }}</ref> Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of ecosystems. * '''Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity''': with a warming of 3°C, relative to 1990 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider ''et al.'', 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4°C (above the 1990–2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe. * '''Marine ecosystems and biodiversity''': with very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:792) concluded that a warming of 2°C above 1990 levels would result in mass mortality of coral reefs globally. * '''Freshwater ecosystems''': above about a 4°C increase in global mean temperature by 2100 (relative to 1990–2000), Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:789) concluded, with high confidence, that many freshwater species would become extinct. ==Abrupt or irreversible changes== ===Abrupt climate change=== [[Abrupt climate change]] is defined as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems (CCSP, 2008a).<ref>{{cite book |year=2008a |author=CCSP |title=Abrupt Climate Change: Summary and Findings (Brochure). A report by the US Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research | authors = Clark, PU, AJ Weaver (coordinating lead authors), E Brook, ER Cook, TL Delworth, and K.

Predictions of such a change are highly uncertain due to a lack of scientific understanding. Modeling of the processes associated with a rapid ice sheet and glacier change could potentially increase future projections of sea level rise. ===The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation=== {{See also|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an important component of the Earth's climate system, characterized by a northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic and a southward flow of colder water in the deep Atlantic (CCSP, 2008b, p.&nbsp;5).<ref>{{cite book |year=2008b |author=CCSP |title=Abrupt Climate Change.

Warming is still expected to occur over most of the European region downstream of the North Atlantic Current in response to increasing greenhouse gases, as well as over North America. Although it is very unlikely that the AMOC will collapse in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe. ===Irreversibilities=== An irreversible change is one where that change, once set in motion, cannot be reversed, at least over some specified timescale, e.g., centuries to millennia (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;22).<ref>{{cite book |year=1996 |author=Goldemberg, J.

The projected range in the TAR (1.4–5.8°C over 1990–2100) is slightly different to that given here (1.1–6.4°C by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, above temperatures averaged over the 1980 to 1999 time period), but the two sets of projections are broadly comparable in size. <sup>2</sup> The IPCC report that is referred to in this article uses specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty (Ahmad ''et al.'', 2001).<ref>{{cite book |year=2001 |author=Ahmad, QK and RA Warrick.
