Scenarios studied by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predict that global warming will continue and get worse much faster than was expected even in their last report.

The expected long range effects of recent [[climate change]] may already be observed. [[Sea level rise|Rising sea levels]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Arctic shrinkage]], and altered patterns of [[Climate change and agriculture|agriculture]] are cited as direct consequences of human activities. Predictions for secondary and regional effects include [[extreme weather]] events, an expansion of [[tropical diseases]], [[phenology|changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems]], and drastic [[Economics of global warming|economic impact]]. Concerns have led to [[Politics of global warming|political]] activism advocating proposals to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]], or [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt]] to it. Many of the effects of global warming are [[non-linear]] in nature, with potential for dramatic [[positive feedback]] effects. This means that the climate may enter a [[critical state]] where small changes can trigger [[runaway climate change|runaway]] or [[abrupt climate change]].{{fact|date=June 2009}} One example of a 'runaway' effect is the release of [[methane]] from [[clathrates]] (known as the [[clathrate gun]] effect).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1029/2004GC000854}}</ref> [[Geoengineering]] has been suggested as a means of interrupting or reversing these effects.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.energy.2004.07.003}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.314.5798.401a}}</ref> The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] by the IPCC includes a summary of the expected effects. == Overview == Climate changes characterized as [[global warming]] are leading to large-scale irreversible<ref name="noaanews.noaa.gov"/> effects at continental and global scales.

As the climate grows warmer and the causes of global dimming are reduced, [[evaporation]] will increase due to warmer oceans. Because the world is a closed system this will cause heavier [[rainfall]], with more [[erosion]]. This erosion, in turn, can in vulnerable tropical areas (especially in Africa) lead to [[desertification]]. On the other hand, in other areas, increased rainfall lead to growth of forests in dry desert areas. Scientists have found evidence that increased evaporation could result in more extreme [[weather]] as global warming progresses.

By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes and [[Antarctica]] in winter.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ==== Sea level rise ==== {{Double image stack|right|Holocene Sea Level.png|Recent Sea Level Rise.png|200|Sea leve rise during the Holocene.|Sea level has been rising {{#expr: 20/120 round 1}} cm/year, based on measurements of [[sea level rise]] from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments.}} {{main|Current sea level rise}} With increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in glaciers, for example, the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s.

The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Positive feedback and runaway greenhouse effect|runaway greenhouse effect]], has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. In 2008, a research expedition for the [[American Geophysical Union]] detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed [[permafrost]], around the outfall of the [[Lena River]] and the area between the [[Laptev Sea]] and [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/exclusive-the-methane-time-bomb-938932.html|title=Exclusive: The methane time bomb|last=Connor|first=Steve|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hundreds-of-methane-plumes-discovered-941456.html|title=Hundreds of methane 'plumes' discovered|last=Connor|first=Steve|date=September 25, 2008|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref><ref>N.

This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Forests/Forests_101/FIRE/Climate_Change.asp | title=Climate Change and Fire | publisher=[[David Suzuki Foundation]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/ImpactsForests.html | title=Global warming : Impacts : Forests | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=2000-01-07 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.whrc.org/southamerica/fire_savann/FeedbackCycles.htm | title= Feedback Cycles: linking forests, climate and landuse activities | publisher=[[Woods Hole Research Center]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the [[Amazon rainforest]], eventually resulting in a transition to [[Caatinga]] vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} ==== Retreat of sea ice ==== {{Double image stack|right|Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|200|Northern Hemisphere ice trends|Southern Hemisphere ice trends}} {{main|Arctic shrinkage|Ice-albedo feedback}} The sea absorbs heat from the sun, while the ice largely reflects the sun rays back to space.

One source of such [[aerosols]] is the [[sulfur cycle]], where [[plankton]] release gases such as [[DMS]] which eventually becomes [[oxidation|oxidised]] to [[sulfur dioxide]] in the atmosphere. Disruption to the oceans as a result of [[ocean acidification]] or disruptions to the [[thermohaline circulation]] may result in disruption of the [[sulfur cycle]], thus reducing its cooling effect on the planet through the creation of [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]]. == Negative feedback effects == {{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} {{Expand-section|date=December 2008}} Following [[Le Chatelier's principle]], the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's [[carbon cycle]] will shift in response to anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> via the so-called [[solubility pump]]. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: "A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer|first=David|year=2005|title= Fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> in geologic time |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=110 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002625|pages= C09S05}} </ref>. However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]]. Also, the [[thermal radiation]] of the Earth rises in proportion to the fourth power of temperature, increasing the amount of outgoing radiation as the Earth warms. The impact of this negative feedback effect is included in [[global climate model]]s summarized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. == Other consequences == [[Image:Edccc.png|right|thumb|300px|As recent estimates of the rate of global warming have increased, so have the financial estimates of the damage costs]] === Economic and social === {{seealso|Economics of global warming}} The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report contains a review of the literature on the economics of climate change: <blockquote>Impacts of climate change are ''very likely'' to impose net annual costs, which will increase over time as global temperatures increase. Peer-reviewed estimates of the [[social cost of carbon]] [Net economic costs of damages from climate change [[aggregate data|aggregate]]d across the globe and [[social discount rate|discounted]] to the specified year] in 2005 average US$12 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>, but the range from 100 estimates is large (-$3 to $95/tCO<sub>2</sub>). This is due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding [[climate sensitivity]], response lags, the treatment of [[risk]] and [[equity (economics)|equity]], economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses and [[social discount rate|discount]] rates. Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions and populations and ''very likely'' underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf|title="IPCC Summary for Policymakers, page 22.

In a 2004 comment on the economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that: {{quote|A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al. 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al. 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al. 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004).

Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al. 2000).

As the northern forests are a [[carbon sink]], while dead forests are a major carbon source, the loss of such large areas of forest has a positive feedback on global warming.

Besides the immediate ecological and economic impact, the huge dead forests provide a fire risk. Even many healthy forests appear to face an increased risk of [[forest fire]]s because of warming climates. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000&nbsp;km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000&nbsp;km² (7 million acres) annually.<ref>[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change] Regional Paper: Alaska</ref>.

Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of [[forest fires]], the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of water. Studies suggest that a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/potential_effects.pdf The Potential Effects Of Global Climate Change On The United States] Report to Congress Editors: Joel B. Smith and Dennis Tirpak US-EPA December 1989</ref> Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Freshwater Issues at ‘Heart of Humankind’S Hopes for Peace and Development’ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2002-12-12]] | url = http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/ENVDEV713.doc.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> ==== Ecological productivity ==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect of improving ecosystems' productivity. In [[photorespiration]], carbon dioxide that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and take the place of carbon dioxide in the [[Calvin cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, suppressing growth. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations tend to reduce photorespiration. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. === Water scarcity === {{seealso|Water crisis}} Sea level rise is projected to increase salt-water intrusion into [[groundwater]] in some regions, affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/GlobalWarming.nsf/content/ResourceCenterPublicationsSeaLevelRiseIndex.html EPA : Global Warming : Resource Center : Publications : Sea Level Rise : Sea Level Rise Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it, leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp Kazakhstan: glaciers and geopolitics] ''Stephan Harrison'' Open Democracy May 2005</ref> The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.
