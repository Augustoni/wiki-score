Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref name="health summary"/> According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri ''et al.''

Projected relative risks attributable to climate change in 2030 varied by health outcome and region. Risks were largely negative, with most of the projected disease burden due to increases in diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition. These increases were primarily in low-income populations already experiencing a large burden of disease. =====Extreme events===== With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors.
