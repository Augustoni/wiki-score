It is predicted that future climate changes will include further global warming (i.e., an upward [[trend estimation|trend]] in global mean temperature), sea level rise, and a probable increase in the frequency of some [[extreme weather|extreme weather events]]. Signatories of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] have agreed to implement policies designed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. == Overview == {{Double image stack|right|Instrumental Temperature Record (NASA).svg|Global Warming Map.jpg|180|Global mean surface temperature difference from the average for 1880-2009|Mean surface temperature change for the period 1999 to 2008 relative to the average temperatures from 1940 to 1980}} Over the last hundred years or so, the instrumental temperature record has shown a trend in climate of increased global mean temperature, i.e., global warming. Other observed changes include [[Arctic shrinkage]], [[Arctic methane release]], releases of terrestrial carbon from [[permafrost]] regions and [[Arctic methane release]] in coastal sediments, and sea level rise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2008/09/17/impacts-on-the-threshold-of-abrupt-climate-changes/ |title=IMPACTS: On the Threshold of Abrupt Climate Changes |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=IMPACTS: On the Threshold of Abrupt Climate Changes |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research |month=September |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hundreds-of-methane-plumes-discovered-941456.html |title=Hundreds of methane 'plumes' discovered |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=Hundreds of methane 'plumes' discovered |publisher=[[The Independent]] |month=September |year=2008 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Connor}}</ref> Global average temperature is predicted to increase over this century, with a probable increase in frequency of some extreme weather events, and changes in rainfall patterns.

With greater levels of warming (greater than 2–3°C by 2100, relative to 1990 temperature levels), it is very likely that benefits will decline and costs increase (IPCC, 2007b:17). Low-[[latitude]] and less-developed areas are probably at the greatest risk from climate change (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:781).<ref name=schneider>{{cite book |author=Schneider, S.H., ''et al''. |chapter=Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|p=781}} }}</ref> With human systems, [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] potential for climate change impacts is considerable, although the costs of adaptation are largely unknown and potentially large. In a literature assessment, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would likely result in reduced diversity of ecosystems and the extinction of many species. ==Definition of climate change== This article refers to reports produced by the IPCC. In their usage, "climate change" refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties, and that persists for extended periods, typically decades or longer (IPCC, 2007d:30).<ref name=ar4syn/> The climate change referred to may be due to natural causes or the result of human activity. ==Physical impacts== {{Main|Physical impacts of climate change}} This section describes physical impacts of climate change. For some of these physical impacts, their effect on social and economic systems are also described. === Effects on weather === Increasing temperature is likely to lead to increasing precipitation <ref name="ar4wg1a">{{cite book |author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |authorlink=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |chapter=Summary for Policymakers: Human influences will continue to change atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=8}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., ''et al.'' |chapter=9.3.6.2 Precipitation and Convection |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/365.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=365}} }}</ref> but the effects on storms are less clear. Extratropical storms partly depend on the [[temperature gradient]], which is predicted to weaken in the northern hemisphere as the polar region warms more than the rest of the hemisphere.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., ''et al.'' |chapter=9.3.6.3 Extra-tropical storms |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/366.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=366}} }}</ref> ==== Extreme weather ==== {{See also|Extreme weather|Tropical cyclone#Global warming|List of Atlantic hurricane records}} IPCC (2007a:8) predicted that in the future, over most land areas, the frequency of warm spells or [[heat wave]]s would very likely increase.<ref name=ar4wg1 /> Other likely changes are listed below: *Increased areas will be affected by [[drought]] *There will be increased intense [[tropical cyclone]] activity *There will be increased incidences of extreme high sea level (excluding [[tsunami]]s) ==== Local climate change ==== {{Main|Regional effects of global warming}} [[Image:Cyclone Catarina 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The first recorded South Atlantic hurricane, [[Cyclone Catarina|"Catarina"]], which hit Brazil in March 2004]] Regional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere. The [[coast]] can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Biogeochemical cycles=== {{See also|climate change feedback}} Climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive "feedback" process . A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process. A positive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it (IPCC, 2007d:78).<ref name=ar4syn/> Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:792).<ref name=schneider/> Using the A2 SRES emissions scenario, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:789) found that this effect led to additional warming by 2100, relative to the 1990-2000 period, of 0.1 to 1.5 °C. This estimate was made with high confidence. The climate projections made in the IPCC Forth Assessment Report of 1.1 to 6.4 °C account for this feedback effect. On the other hand, with medium confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007) commented that additional releases of GHGs were possible from permafrost, peat lands, wetlands, and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes. ===Glacier retreat and disappearance=== {{Main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}} [[Image:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|250px|left|thumb|A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970. Thinning in orange and red, thickening in blue.]] IPCC (2007a:5) found that, on average, mountain glaciers and snow cover had decreased in both the northern and southern hemispheres.<ref name= ar4wg1 /> This widespread decrease in glaciers and ice caps has contributed to observed sea level rise. With very high or high confidence, IPCC (2007d:11) made a number of predictions relating to future changes in glaciers:<ref name=ar4syn>{{cite web |date=2007d |title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ====Acidification==== {{Main|Ocean acidification}} Dissolving {{chem|CO|2}} in seawater increases the [[hydrogen]] ion ({{chem|H|+}}) concentration in the ocean, and thus decreases ocean pH. [[Ken Caldeira|Caldeira]] and Wickett (2003) placed the rate and magnitude of modern ocean acidification changes in the context of probable historical changes during the last 300 million years.<ref name=caldeira>{{cite journal |author=Caldeira, K. and M.E.

IPCC (2007a) were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993 to 2003 was due to natural variations in sea level over the time period, or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term trend. IPCC (2007a:13, 14) projected sea level rise to the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century using the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] emission [[economics of global warming#Scenarios|scenarios]]. Across the six SRES marker scenarios, sea level was projected to rise by 18 to 59&nbsp;cm (7.1 to 23.2&nbsp;inches). This projection was for the time period 2090-2099, with the increase in level relative to average sea levels over the 1980-1999 period. Due to a lack of scientific understanding, this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets. ====Shutdown of thermohaline circulation==== {{Main|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} There is some speculation that global warming could, via a shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localized cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming, in that region.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1073/pnas.0705414105}}</ref> This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. IPCC (2007b:17) concluded that a slowing of the [[Thermohaline circulation|Meridional Overturning Circulation]] would very likely occur this century. Due to global warming, temperatures across the Atlantic and Europe were still projected to increase. ====Temperature rise==== From 1961 to 2003, the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10 °C from the surface to a depth of 700 m. There is variability both year-to-year and over longer time scales, with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 1991 to 2003, but some cooling from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bindoff, N.L., J.

(2007:787) concluded that for about a 1 to 3°C global mean temperature increase (by 2100, relative to the 1990-2000 average level) there would be productivity decreases for some [[cereal]]s in low latitudes, and productivity increases in high latitudes. With medium confidence, global production potential was predicted to: *increase up to around 3°C, *very likely decrease above about 3 to 4°C. Most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:790) had not incorporated a number of critical factors, including changes in extreme events, or the spread of pests and diseases. Studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid adaptation. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.''., 2007:393).<ref>{{cite book |author=Confalonieri, U. ''et al''. |chapter=Human health |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=391–431}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Confalonieri ''et al.''. (2007:393), the effects of climate change to date have been small, but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions. With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''. (2007:393) concluded that climate change had altered the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species. With medium confidence, they concluded that climate change had: *altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors *increased heatwave-related deaths With high confidence, IPCC (2007d:48) projected that:<ref name=ar4syn/> *the health status of millions of people would be affected through, for example, increases in [[malnutrition]]; increased deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; increased burden of [[Diarrhea|diarrhoeal disease]]s; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to high concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change; and altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases. *climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in Africa. Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure. ====Specific health impacts==== {{POV-section|date=May 2010|Malaria}} {{Cleanup split|Climate change, industry and society|date=May 2010}} '''Malnutrition''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

These increases were primarily in low-income populations already experiencing a large burden of disease. '''Extreme events''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

The impacts of weather disasters is considerable and unequally distributed. For example, natural disasters have been shown to result in increased domestic violence against - and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorders]] in – [[women]]. In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors. High-density populations in low-lying coastal regions experience a high health burden from weather disasters. ''Heatwaves'' Hot days, hot nights and heatwaves have become more frequent (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-1.html "8.2.1.1 Heatwaves"]</ref> Heatwaves are associated with marked short-term increases in mortality. For example, in August 2003, a heatwave in Europe resulted in excess mortality in the range of 35,000 total deaths. Heat-related morbidity and mortality is projected to increase (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-3.html "8.4.1.3 Heat- and cold-related mortality"]</ref> The health burden could be relatively small for moderate heatwaves in temperate regions, because deaths occur primarily in susceptible persons. ''Drought'' The effects of drought on health include deaths, malnutrition, [[infectious disease]]s and [[respiratory disease]]s (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s823/> Countries within the "[[Meningitis]] Belt" in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]] and [[epidemic]] frequency of [[meningococcal disease|meningococcal]] meningitis in Africa, although other areas in the Rift Valley, the Great Lakes, and southern Africa are also affected (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-3-1.html "8.2.3.1 Drought and infectious disease"]</ref> The spatial distribution, intensity, and seasonality of meningococcal (epidemic) meningitis appear to be strongly linked to climate and environmental factors, particularly drought.

Climate change has also been implicated in changes in the breeding and migration dates of several bird species. Several species of wild bird can act as carriers of human [[pathogen]]s as well as of vectors of infectious agents. ''Dengue'' It is possible<sup>d</sup> that climate change will increase the number of people at risk of dengue (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> Based on the expert judgement of Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007), this projection had about a two-in-ten chance of being correct. [[dengue fever|Dengue]] is the world's most important vector-borne viral disease (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Confalonieri, U., B. Menne, R. Akhtar, K.L.

''Malaria'' The spatial distribution, intensity of transmission, and seasonalty of [[malaria]] is influenced by climate in [[Sub-saharan Africa]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Confalonieri, U., B.

This version: IPCC website |isbn=9780521880107 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref> Rainfall can be a limiting factor for mosquito populations and there is some evidence of reductions in transmission associated with decadal decreases in rainfall. The effects of observed climate change on the geographical distribution of malaria and its transmission intensity in highland regions remains controversial. There is no clear evidence that malaria has been affected by climate change in South America or in continental regions of the Russian Federation. There is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales. {{Undue|paragraph|date=May 2010}} A paper by researchers from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Florida]] published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in May 2010 concluded that claims that a warming climate has led to more widespread disease and death due to malaria are largely at odds with the evidence, and that "''predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.''"<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Climate change and the global malaria recession|author=Peter W.

This version: IPCC website |isbn=9780521880091 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref> Given this limitation, models assessed by Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that, particularly in Africa, climate change would be associated with geographical expansions of the areas suitable for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in some regions, and contractions in other regions. Projections also suggested that some regions would experience a longer season of transmission. Projections suggested expansions in vector species that carry dengue for parts of Australia and New Zealand. '''Diarrhoeal diseases''' With medium confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases.<ref name=wg2c8es/> Childhood mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains high (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-5.html "8.2.5 Water and disease"]</ref> This is despite improvements in care. Several studies have shown that transmission of [[intestine|enteric]] pathogens is higher during the rainy season. Some studies have found that higher temperature was strongly associated with increased episodes of diarrhoeal disease in adults and children in Peru. The WHO study, referred to earlier, projected that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income regions by approximately 2 to 5% in 2020 (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8411/> '''Ground-level ozone''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality associated with ground-level [[ozone]].<ref name=wg2c8es/> Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and is the primary constituent of urban [[smog]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-6.html "8.2.6 Air quality and disease"]</ref> Ozone in smog is formed through chemical reactions involving [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other compounds. The reaction is a [[photochemical reaction]], meaning that it involves [[electromagnetic radiation]], and occurs in the presence of bright sunshine and high temperatures. Exposure to elevated concentrations of ozone is associated with increased hospital admissions for [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], allergic [[rhinitis]] and other respiratory diseases, and with premature mortality. Background levels of ground-level ozone have risen since pre-industrial times because of increasing emissions of methane, [[carbon monoxide]] and nitrogen oxides (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-4.html "8.4.1.4 Urban air quality"]</ref> This trend is expected to continue into the mid-21<sup>st</sup> century. '''Cold-waves''' It is expected that<sup>b</sup> climate change will bring some health benefits (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> It is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by negative climate change effects. [[cold wave|Cold-waves]] continue to be a problem in northern latitudes, where very low temperatures can be reached in a few hours and extend over long periods (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-2.html "8.2.1.2 Cold-waves"]</ref> Reductions in cold-deaths due to climate change are projected to be greater than increases in heat-related deaths in the UK (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413/> ===Water resources=== {{See also|Water crisis}} In a literature assessment, Kundzewicz ''et al.''. (2007:175) concluded, with high confidence, that:<ref>{{cite book |author=Kundzewicz Z.W. ''et al''. |chapter=Freshwater resources and their management |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch3.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=173–210}} }}</ref> *the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. All of the regions assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic), and small islands) showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. *Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater. With very high confidence, it was judged that many of these areas, e.g., the Mediterranean basin, western USA, southern Africa, and north-eastern Brazil, would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. ===Migration and conflict=== An argument can be made that rising ethnic conflicts may be linked to competition over natural resources that are increasingly scarce as a result of climate change (Wilbanks ''et al.''., 2007:365).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wilbanks, T.J. ''et al''. |chapter=Industry, settlement and society |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch7.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=357–390}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Wilbanks ''et al.''. (2007:365), other factors need to be taken into account. It was suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa have more to do with the relative abundance of resources, e.g., oil and diamonds, than with resource scarcity. On this basis, Wilbanks ''et al.''. (2007:365) suggested that predictions of future conflicts due climate change should be viewed with caution. With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:787) predicted that stresses such as increased drought, water shortages, and riverine and coastal flooding would affect many local and regional populations.<ref name=schneider/> With medium confidence, it was predicted that these stresses would lead, in some cases, to relocation within or between countries. This might have the effect of exacerbating conflicts, and possibly impose migration pressures. Zhang ''et al'' also concluded that climate change drives conflict.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0703073104}}</ref> ===Aggregate impacts=== {{Main|Economics of global warming}} Aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007d:76).<ref name=ar4syn/> The impacts of climate change across world population will not be distributed evenly (Smith ''et al.'', 2001:957).<ref name=smith/> IPCC (2007b:17) found that for increases in global mean temperature of less than 1-3 °C above 1990 levels, some impacts were projected to produce benefits in some places and sectors, and produce costs in other places and sectors.<ref name=ar4wg2/> For some low-latitude and polar regions, net costs were projected for small increases in temperature. According to IPCC (2007b:17), a temperature increase of greater than about 2-3 °C would very likely result in all regions either experiencing reductions in net benefits or increases in net costs. ==Regions== Some regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change (IPCC, 2007d:9):<ref name=ar4syn/> *The Arctic, because of high rates of projected warming. *Africa, especially in the sub-Saharan region. This is due to the continent's low capacity to adapt to climate change and projected impacts. *Small islands, due to high exposure of population and infrastructure at risk to sea-level rise and increased storm surge. *Asian megadeltas, due to large populations and high exposure to sea-level rise, storm surge and river flooding. Within other areas, some people are particularly at risk, such as the poor, young children and the elderly. ==Biological systems== {{Main|Climate change and ecosystems}} {{See also|Extinction risk from global warming|Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity|Effects of climate change on marine mammals}} With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded that regional temperature trends were already affecting species and ecosystems around the world.<ref name=schneider/> In a literature assessment, Rosenzweig ''et al.''. (2007:81) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernable influence on many physical and biological systems.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rosenzweig, C. ''et al''. |chapter=Assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch1.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=79–131}} }}</ref> Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of ecosystems. *'''Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity''': With a warming of 3°C, relative to 1990 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4°C (above the 1990-2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe. *'''Marine ecosystems and biodiversity''': With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded that a warming of 2°C above 1990 levels would result in mass mortality of coral reefs globally. *'''Freshwater ecosystems''': Above about a 4°C increase in global mean temperature by 2100 (relative to 1990-2000), Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:789) concluded, with high confidence, that many freshwater species would become extinct. ==Footnotes== The IPCC report that is referred to in this article uses specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty (Ahmad ''et al.'', 2001).<ref>{{cite book |year=2001 |author=Ahmad, Q.K. and R.A.
