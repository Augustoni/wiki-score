The '''effects of climate change''' span the impacts on [[physical environment]], [[ecosystems]] and human societies due to ongoing human-caused [[climate change]]. The future impact of climate change depends on how much nations reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapt]] to climate change.<ref name=""adaptation and mitigation"">Oppenheimer, M., ''et al.'', ''Section 19.7.1: Relationship between Adaptation Efforts, Mitigation Efforts, and Residual Impacts,'' in: [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf Chapter 19: Emergent risks and key vulnerabilities] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20141020014746/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf 20 October 2014]), pp.1080–1085, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}

In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the [[tropics]]. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing [[Ocean current|currents in the oceans]].

Physical changes include [[extreme weather]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], sea level rise, [[Arctic sea ice decline|declines in Arctic sea ice]], and changes in the timing of seasonal events (such as earlier spring flowering). Since 1970, the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the [[ocean heat content|excess heat]] in the climate system. Even if global surface temperature is stabilized, sea levels will continue to rise and the ocean will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere for many centuries.<ref name=""ReferenceA"" /> The uptake of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]] is leading to [[ocean acidification]].<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite book|title=IPCC SROCC Summary for Policymakers|year=2019|page=9}}</ref>

Climate change has [[land degradation|degraded land]] by raising temperatures, [[Water scarcity|drying soils]] and increasing [[wildfire]] risk.<ref name=""ReferenceB"">{{cite book|title=IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|year=2019|page=9}}</ref> Recent warming has strongly affected natural biological systems.<ref name=""rosenzweig observed impacts"" /> Species worldwide are migrating poleward to colder areas.

[[Food security]] and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures. Climate change has profound impacts on human health, directly via heat stress and indirectly via the spread of infectious diseases. 

The vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries.

If emissions of {{CO2}} were to be abruptly stopped and no [[negative emission technologies]] deployed, the Earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state. Instead, temperatures would stay elevated at the same level for several centuries.

Mitigation policies currently in place will result in about 2.7&nbsp;°C (2.0–3.6&nbsp;°C, depending on how [[climate sensitivity|sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions]]) warming above pre-industrial levels. If all unconditional pledges and targets made by governments are achieved the temperature will rise by around 2.4&nbsp;°C. If  additionally all the countries that adopted or are considering to adopt net-zero targets will achieve it the temperature will rise by a median of 1.8&nbsp;°C.

=== Precipitation (rainfall) ===
{{See also|Effects of climate change on the water cycle}}

Warming by greenhouse gas forcing has increased contrasts in rainfall amounts between wet and dry seasons.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6, line 51}}</ref> This means colloquially: ""wet seasons are getting wetter, dry seasons are getting drier"". Warming has also resulted in a detectable increase in the precipitation of northern [[Polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]].<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"" />

Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation and surface drying. As the air warms, its water-holding capacity also increases, particularly over the oceans. Air holds 7% more [[water vapour]] for every degree Celsius it is warmed.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8_b2"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6,8–119}}</ref> Changes have already been observed in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation.

Global warming is expected to be accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some [[equatorial region]]s. In other words, regions which are dry at present will generally become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will generally become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, [[South Africa]], [[southern Australia]], the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]], and the [[Southwestern United States|south-western U.S.]]), a pattern that can be described as a poleward expansion of these semi-arid zones.<!-- This entire paragraph is based on the following reference --><ref name=""NOAA_GFDL_b"">

In the case of [[precipitation]], the rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's [[water cycle]], increasing evaporation. Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense downpours and cause extended droughts in certain regions. As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and an increased risk of flooding. In contrast, areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern [[latitudes]], and least warming over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=IPCC_synthesis_2007>

Global warming not only causes changes in tropical cyclones, it may also make some impacts from them worse via sea level rise. The intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) is projected to increase globally, with the proportion of [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category 4 and 5]] tropical cyclones increasing.

Between 1994 and 2006, satellite observations shows an 18% increase in the flow of freshwater into the world's oceans, partly from melting ice and partly from increased precipitation driven by an increase in global ocean evaporation.

Even though weather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires, the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased globally. This is mostly the result of the conversion of [[savanna]] into [[croplands]], after which there is less forest area that can burn. [[Prescribed burning]], an indigenous practice in the US and Australia, can reduce the area burnt too, and may form an adaptation to increased risk.<ref name="":13"" /> The carbon released from wildfires can further increase greenhouse gas concentrations.

These physical changes disturb marine ecosystems, which can cause both extinctions and population explosions, change the distribution of species,<ref name=""SROCC_SPM_20190925"" /> and impact coastal fishing and tourism.

The reduced up and down mixing reduces the ability of the ocean to absorb heat, directing a larger fraction of future warming toward the atmosphere and land. Energy available for tropical cyclones and other storms is expected to increase, [[nutrient]]s for fish in the upper ocean layers are set to decrease, as well as the capacity of the oceans to [[Carbon sink|store carbon]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Freedman|first=Andrew|date=29 September 2020|title=Mixing of the planet's ocean waters is slowing down, speeding up global warming, study finds|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/29/global-ocean-layers-warming/|url-status=live|access-date=12 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015040856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/29/global-ocean-layers-warming/|archive-date=15 October 2020|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Warmer water cannot contain as much oxygen as cold water, changing the gas exchange equilibrium to reduce ocean oxygen levels and increase oxygen in the atmosphere. Increased thermal stratification may lead to increases in respiration rates of organic matter, further decreasing water oxygen content. The ocean has already lost oxygen, throughout the entire water column and [[oxygen minimum zone]]s are expanding worldwide.<ref name="":0"" /> This has adverse consequences for ocean life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crowley|first1=T.

[[Water resources]] can be affected by climate change in various ways. The total amount of [[freshwater]] available can change, for instance due to [[dry spell]]s or droughts. Heavy rainfall and flooding can have an impact on water quality: pollutants can be transported into water bodies by the increased [[surface runoff]]. In coastal regions, more salt may find its way into water resources due to higher sea levels and more intense storms. Higher temperatures also directly degrade water quality: warm water contains less oxygen.<ref name=""IPCC2022_FAQ4.1"" />{{excerpt|Water security#Changes in the future environment (climate change)|paragraphs=1–2|file=no}}

Economic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably. Researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the impact of potentially catastrophic climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages. Nevertheless, one 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2&nbsp;°C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kompas|first1=Tom|last2=Pham|first2=Van Ha|last3=Che|first3=Tuong Nhu|date=2018|title=The Effects of Climate Change on GDP by Country and the Global Economic Gains From Complying With the Paris Climate Accord|journal=Earth's Future|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1029/2018EF000922|issn=2328-4277|doi-access=free|bibcode=2018EaFut...6.1153K}}</ref>

[[Insurance]] is an important tool to manage risks, but often unavailable to poorer households.

=== Displacement and migration ===
{{Further|Climate migrant}}
Climate change affects displacement of people in several ways. Firstly, involuntary displacement may increase through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats. Effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments.

Gradual but pervasive environmental change and sudden natural disasters both influence the nature and extent of human migration but in different ways.

Governments have considered various approaches to reduce migration compelled by environmental conditions in at-risk communities, including programs of social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management.  Some experts support migration as an appropriate way for people to cope with environmental changes.  However, this is controversial because migrants – particularly low-skilled ones – are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<ref name=""beta.adb.org""/>

Climate change can worsen conflicts by exacerbating tensions over limited resources like [[drinking water]] (in the case of [[Water conflict|water conflicts]]).

==== Low-lying coastal regions ====
[[File:Cyclone Nargis flooding before-and-after.jpg|thumb|Floodplains and low-lying coastal areas will flood more frequently due to climate change, like this area of [[Myanmar]] which was submerged by [[Cyclone Nargis]]]]For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the [[coast]]. In developing countries, the poorest often live on [[floodplain]]s, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as [[Levee|dyke]]s and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.

Socioeconomic impacts of climate change in coastal and low-lying areas will be overwhelmingly adverse. The following impacts were projected in 2007 with very high confidence:<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Robert J. |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |title=Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |publisher=IPCC; Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0521880107 |editor-last=Parry |editor-first=M.L. |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=315–356 |section=Coastal systems and low-lying areas |display-authors=etal |access-date=6 June 2018 |editor-last2=Canziani |editor-first2=O.F. |editor-last3=Palutikof |editor-first3=J.P. |editor-last4=van der Linden |editor-first4=P.J. |editor-last5=Hanson |editor-first5=C.E. |display-editors=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122140622/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |archive-date=22 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

*By the 2080s, millions of people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying mega-deltas of Asia and Africa; and smaller islands were judged to be especially vulnerable.

The main effect is an increasing global average temperature. From this flow a variety of resulting effects, namely, rising sea levels, altered patterns of [[agriculture]], increased extreme weather events, and the expansion of the range of tropical diseases. In some cases, the effects may already be occurring, although it is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term [[global warming]]. The extent and likelihood of these consequences is a matter of considerable political [[global warming controversy|controversy]]; and in the details, a matter of some scientific uncertainty. A summary of possible effects and our current understanding can be found in the report of the [[IPCC]] Working Group II [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/index.htm]; a discussion of projected climate changes is found in WG I [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/364.htm]. Proposed responses to the effects of global warming fall into two categories: [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]]. == Effects of Global Warming == Projected climate changes due to [[global warming]] have the potential to lead to future large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in our climate resulting in impacts at continental and global scales. Examples of projected climate changes include: * significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, * large reductions in the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets, * accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial biosphere, and * releases of terrestrial carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments. The likelihood of many of these changes is uncertain. However, the probability of one or more of these changes occurring is likely to increase with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change. The effects of global warming are not uniformly negative. Global warming will lead to climate change which will have positive benefits in some regions and negative effects in others. Scientists are unable to accurately predict when various effects of global warming will occur or what the magnitude of the effect will be. For this reason, it is not possible to be certain whether the positive benefits will outweigh the negative impacts. What is known is that some significant negative impacts are projected and these drive most of the concern about global warming and motivates attempts to mitigate or adapt to the effects of global warming. Most of the consequences of global warming would result from one of three physical changes: sea level rise, higher local temperatures, and changes in rainfall patterns (Figure 1). Sea level is generally expected to rise 50-200 cm in the next century (Dean et al. 1987); such a rise would inundate 7,000 square miles of dry land in the United States (an area the size of Massachusetts) and a similar amount of coastal wetlands; erode recreational beaches 100-200 meters, exacerbate coastal flooding; and increase the salinity of aquifers and estuaries (Titus 1989). ===Effects on weather === Increasing temperature is likely to lead to increasing precipitation [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm] [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/365.htm] but the effects on storms are less clear. Extratropical storms partly depend on the temperature ''gradient'', which is predicted to weaken in the northern hemisphere as the polar region warms more than the rest of the hemisphere [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/366.htm]. ==== More extreme weather ==== The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]]) [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] ""Climate Change 2001"" stated ""there is no compelling evidence to indicate that the characteristics of tropical and extratropical storms have changed."" [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/014.htm#aspects] There is, however, limited evidence from a relatively short time period that storm strength is increasing, such as the Emanuel (2005) ""power dissipation index"" of hurricane intensity [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=181]. Worldwide, the proportion of [[hurricane]]s reaching [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|categories 4 or 5]] – with wind speeds above 56 metres per second – has risen from 20% in the 1970s to 35% in the 1990s.[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8002] Precipitation hitting the US from hurricanes increased by 7% over the twentieth century [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/mg18625054.800]. See also [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1109337,00.html Time Magazine's ""Global Warming: The Culprit?""] and [http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2622.htm]. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0703-05.htm] has suggested a possible link between global warming and increasing extreme weather events, as have Hoyos ''et al.'' (2006), writing, ""the increasing ... number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes ... is directly linked to"" increasing temperatures. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1123560v1] Hurricane modeling has produced similar results, e.g., ""hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, are more intense ... than under present-day conditions.... greenhouse gas–induced warming may lead to ... increasing ... occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms."" [http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/reference/bibliography/2004/tk0401.pdf] A paper by 14 scientists [http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-1776-2005.42.pdf] notes that ""research shows very little evidence to support the claim that the rising costs associated with weather ... are associated with changes in [their] frequency or intensity."" The IPCC TAR, in 2001, made no strong statements on the issue. A substantially higher risk of extreme weather does not necessarily mean a noticeably greater risk of slightly-above-average weather [http://www.climateprediction.net/science/pubs/ccs_allen.pdf]. However, the evidence is clear that severe weather and moderate rainfall are also increasing. Stephen Mwakifwamba, national co-ordinator of the Centre for Energy, Environment, Science and Technology - which prepared the Tanzanian government's climate change report to the UN - says that change is happening in [[Tanzania]] right now. ""In the past, we had a drought about every 10 years"", he says. ""Now we just don't know when they will come. They are more frequent, but then so are floods. The climate is far less predictable. We might have floods in May or droughts every three years. Upland areas, which were never affected by mosquitoes, now are. Water levels are decreasing every day. The rains come at the wrong time for farmers and it is leading to many problems"" [http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517935,00.html]. Greg Holland, director of the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Boulder, Colorado, said on April 24, 2006, ""The hurricanes we are seeing are indeed a direct result of climate change,"" and that the wind and warmer water conditions that fuel storms that form in the Caribbean are, ""increasingly due to greenhouse gases. There seems to be no other conclusion you can logically draw."" Holland said, ""The large bulk of the scientific community say what we are seeing now is linked directly to greenhouse gases."" [http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/04/25/global.warming.hurricanes.reut/index.html] (See also ""Global warming?"" in [[tropical cyclone]]) ====Increased evaporation==== [[Image:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|350px|Increasing water vapor at Boulder, Colorado.]] As the climate grows warmer, [[evaporation]] will increase. This may cause heavier [[rainfall]] and more [[erosion]], and in more vulnerable tropical areas (especially in Africa), [[desertification]] due to [[tropical deforestation|deforestation]]. Many scientists think that it could result in more extreme [[weather]] as global warming progresses. The IPCC Third Annual Report says: ""...global average water vapour concentration and precipitation are projected to increase during the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes and [[Antarctica]] in winter. At low latitudes there are both regional increases and decreases over land areas. Larger year to year variations in precipitation are very likely over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected"" [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm] [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/364.htm]. ====Cost of more extreme weather==== The economic impact of extreme weather is rising rapidly both because of increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and because of changes in human behavior. An example of how human behavior has increased exposure to extreme weather is the movement towards greater development along vulnerable seacoasts. The economic impact of hurricanes has increased because there is more development along seacoasts vulnerable to hurricanes. Similarly, the economic impact of floods has increased because there is more development in floodplains. Choi and Fisher, writing in ''Climate Change,'' vol. 58 (2003) pp. 149, predict that each 1% increase in annual precipitation would enlarge the cost of catastrophic storms by 2.8%. The Association of British Insurers has stated that limiting carbon emissions would avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s. The cost is also increasing partly because of building in exposed areas such as coasts and floodplains. The ABI claims that reduction of the vulnerability to some inevitable impacts of climate change, for example through more resilient buildings and improved ﬂood defences, could also result in considerable cost-savings in the longterm.[http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf] ==== Destabilization of local climates ==== [[Image:Brazil hurricane.jpg|thumbnail|The first recorded South Atlantic hurricane, [[Cyclone Catarina|""Catarina""]], which hit Brazil in 2004]] In the northern hemisphere, the southern part of the [[Arctic]] region (home to 4,000,000 people) has experienced a temperature rise 1° to 3° Celsius over the last 50 years. [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are experiencing initial melting of [[permafrost]]. This may disrupt ecosystems and by increasing bacterial activity in the soil lead to these areas becoming carbon sources instead of [[carbon sink]]s [http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_romanovsky.html]. A study (published in ''Science'') of changes to eastern [[Siberia]]'s [[permafrost]] suggests that it is gradually disappearing in the southern regions, leading to the loss of nearly 11% of Siberia's nearly 11,000 lakes since 1971 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1503170,00.html]. At the same time, western Siberia is at the initial stage where melting permafrost is creating new lakes, which will eventually start disappearing as in the east. Western Siberia is the world's largest [[peat bog]], and the melting of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of methane&mdash;creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725124.500]. [[Hurricane]]s were thought to be an entirely north Atlantic phenomenon. In April 2004, the first Atlantic hurricane to form south of the Equator hit [[Brazil]] with 40 m/s (144 km/h) winds; monitoring systems may have to be extended 1,600 km (1000 miles) further south [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_4688_133/ai_n6157847]. === Oceans === ==== Sea level rise ==== {{main|sea level rise}} With increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in glaciers and the [[polar ice cap]]s. An increase of 1.5 to 4.5 °C is estimated to lead to an increase of 15 to 95 cm (IPCC 2001). The sea level has risen more than 120 [[metre]]s since the peak of the last [[ice age]] about 18,000 years ago. The bulk of that occurred before 6000 years ago. From 3000 years ago to the start of the 19th century, sea level was almost constant, rising at 0.1 to 0.2 [[mm]]/yr; since 1900, the level has risen at 1&ndash;2 mm/yr [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/425.htm]; since [[1992]], [[satellite]] altimetry from [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] indicates a rate of about 3 mm/yr [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/426.htm]. ==== Temperature rise ==== The temperature of the Antarctic [[Southern Ocean]] rose by 0.17 °C (0.31 °F) between the 1950s and the 1980s, nearly twice the rate for the world's oceans as a whole [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5558/1275?ijkey=nFvdOLNYlMNZU&keytype=ref&siteid=sci]. As well as effects on ecosystems (eg by melting sea ice, affecting algae that grow on its underside), warming could reduce the ocean's ability to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. More important for the [[United States]] may be the temperature rise in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As hurricanes cross the warm [[Loop Current]] coming up from [[South America]], they can gain great strength in under a day (as did [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] in [[2005]]), with water above 85 degrees F seemingly promoting Category 5 storms. Hurricane season ends in November as the waters cool. ==== Acidification ==== {{main|ocean acidification}} The world’s oceans soak up much of the carbon dioxide produced by living organisms, either as dissolved gas, or in the skeletons of tiny marine creatures that fall to the bottom to become chalk or limestone. Oceans currently absorb about one metric tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> per person per year. It is estimated that the oceans have absorbed around half of all CO<sub>2</sub> generated by human activities since 1800 (120,000,000,000 tonnes or 120 [[petagram]]s of carbon) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5682/367/DC1]. But in water, carbon dioxide becomes a weak [[carbonic acid]], and the increase in the greenhouse gas since the [[industrial revolution]] has already lowered the average [[pH]] (the laboratory measure of acidity) of seawater by 0.1 units on the 14-point scale, to 8.2. Predicted emissions could lower it by a further 0.5 by 2100, to a level not seen for millions of years.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4633681.stm] There are concerns that increasing acidification could have a particularly detrimental effect on [[coral]]s [http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2558.jsp] (16% of the world's coral reefs have died from bleaching since 1998 [http://sun1.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/nhedinst/NATURE_416_389-395_2002.pdf]) and other marine organisms with [[calcium carbonate]] shells. Increased acidity may also directly affect the growth and reproduction of fish as well as the [[plankton]] on which they rely on for food [http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article-6-129-2480.jsp]. ==== Shutdown of thermohaline circulation==== {{main|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} There is some speculation that global warming could, via a shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localised cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming, in that region. This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. The chances of this occurring are unclear; there is some evidence for the stability of the Gulf Stream and possible weakening of the North Atlantic drift. There is, however, no evidence for cooling in northern Europe or nearby seas; quite the reverse. ===Ecosystems=== Rising temperatures are beginning to have a noticeable impact on ecosystems. Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; lessened snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also the [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems may change; some [[species]] may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Many of the species at risk are arctic fauna such as [[Polar Bear|polar bears]], emperor penguins, many salt wetland flora and fauna species, and any species that inhabit the low land areas near the sea. Species that rely on cold weather conditions such as gyrfalcons, and snowy owls that prey on lemmings that use the cold winter to their advantage will be hit hard. [[Butterfly|Butterflies]] have shifted their ranges northward by 200 km in Europe and North America. Plants lag behind, and larger animals' migration is slowed down by cities and highways. In Britain, spring butterflies are appearing an average of 6 days earlier than two decades ago [http://sun1.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/nhedinst/NATURE_416_389-395_2002.pdf]. In the Arctic, the waters of [[Hudson Bay]] are ice-free for three weeks longer than they were thirty years ago, affecting [[Polar Bear|polar bears]], which do not hunt on land [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n01/byer01_.html]. Two 2002 studies in ''Nature'' (vol 421) [http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20115/naturefingerprints.pdf] surveyed the scientific literature to find recent changes in range or seasonal behaviour by plant and animal species. Of species showing recent change, 4 out of 5 shifted their ranges towards the poles or higher altitudes, creating ""[[refugee species]]"". Frogs were breeding, flowers blossoming and birds migrating an average 2.3 days earlier each decade; butterflies, birds and plants moving towards the poles by 6.1 km per decade [http://www.animana.org/tab2/22refugespeciesfeelingtheheat.shtml]. A 2005 study concludes human activity is the cause of the temperature rise and resultant changing species behaviour, and links these effects with the predictions of [[climate model]]s to provide validation for them [http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20887/PNAS_5_16_05.pdf]. [[Grass]] has become established in [[Antarctica]] for the first time. [http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=5014&method=full] Forests in some regions potentially face an increased risk of [[forest fire]]s. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000 km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000 km² (7 million acres) annually. [http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm]. This change may be due in part to changes in forest management practices. ====Ecological productivity==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect, up to a point, of improving ecosystems' productivity. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is rare in comparison to oxygen (less than 1% of air compared to 21% of air). This carbon dioxide starvation becomes apparent in [[photorespiration]], where there is so little carbon dioxide, that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and takes the place where carbon dioxide normally would be in the [[Calvin Cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, badly suppressing growth. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. ===Glacier Retreat=== [[Image:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|300px|right|thumb|A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970. Thinning in orange and red, thickening in blue.]] [[Image:Lewist.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Lewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away]] In historic times, glaciers grew during the [[Little Ice Age]], a cool period from about 1550 to 1850. Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as climate warmed. [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|Glacier retreat]] declined and reversed, in many cases, from 1950 to 1980 as a slight global cooling occurred. Since 1980, glacier retreat has become increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that it has threatened the existence of many of the glaciers of the world. This process has increased markedly since 1995. [http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/] The total surface area of [[glacier]]s worldwide has decreased by 50% since the end of the 19th century [http://www.munichre.com/pages/03/georisks/geo_climate/glaciers/glaciers_en.aspx]. Currently glacier retreat rates and mass balance losses have been increasing in the Andes, Alps, Himalaya's, Rocky Mountains and North Cascades. As of March 2005, the snow cap that has covered the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] for the past 11,000 years since the last [[ice age]] has almost disappeared [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1437549,00.html]. The loss of glaciers not only directly causes landslides, flash floods and [[glacial lake]] overflow[http://www.rrcap.unep.org/issues/glof/], but also increases annual variation in water flows in rivers. Glacier runoff declines in the summer as glaciers decrease in size, this decline is already observable in several regions [http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier.htm]. Glaciers retain water on mountains in high precipitation years, since the snow cover accumulating on glaciers protects the ice from melting. In warmer and drier years, glaciers offset the lower precipitation amounts with a higher meltwater input [http://www.munichre.com/pages/03/georisks/geo_climate/glaciers/glaciers_en.aspx]. Of particular importance are the [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Himalaya]]n glacial melts. The melt of these glaciers is a large and reliable source of water for [[China]], [[India]], and much of [[Asia]], and these waters form the principal dry-season water source many of the regions major rivers, including the [[Ganges]]. Increased melting would cause greater flow for several decades, after which "" some areas of the most populated regions on Earth are likely to 'run out of water' "" [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04141.html] The recession of mountain glaciers, notably in Western North America, Franz-Josef Land, Asia, the Alps, Indonesia and Africa, and tropical and sub-tropical regions of South America, has been used to provide qualitative support to the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century. Many glaciers are being lost to melting further raising concerns about future local water resources in these glacierized areas. The Lewis Glacier, North Cascades pictured at right after melting away in 1990 is one of the 47 North Cascade glaciers observed and all are retreating [http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/]. Despite their proximity and importance to human populations, the mountain and valley glaciers of temperate latitudes amount to a small fraction of glacial ice on the earth. About 99% is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar Antarctica and Greenland. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, 3 km (1.8 miles) or more in thickness, cap the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean. Glacier retreat has been observed in these outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate. In Greenland the period since the year 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched, Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, jointly drain more than 16% of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, retreating 7.2 km (4.5 miles) between 2001 and 2005. It has also accelerated from 20 m (65 ft)/day to 32 m (104 ft)/day.[http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp] [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] in west Greenland is generally considered the fastest moving glacier in the world. It had been moving continuously at speeds of over 24 m (78 ft)/day with a stable terminus since at least 1950. In 2002, the 12 km (7.5 mile) long floating terminus entered a phase of rapid retreat. The ice front started to break up and the floating terminus disintegrated accelerating to a retreat rate of over 30 m (98 ft)/day. The acceleration rate of retreat of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is even larger. Portions of the main trunk that were flowing at 15 m (49 ft)/day in 1988-2001 were flowing at 40 m (131 ft)/day in summer 2005. The front of the glacier has also retreated and has rapidly thinned by more than 100 m (328 ft).[http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html] Glacier retreat and acceleration is also apparent on two important outlet glaciers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Pine Island Glacier, which flows into the Amundsen Sea thinned 3.5 ± 0.9 m (11.5 ± 3 ft) per year and retreated five kilometers (3.1 miles) in 3.8 years. The terminus of the glacier is a floating ice shelf and the point at which it is afloat is retreating 1.2 km/year. This glacier drains a substantial portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and has been referred to as the weak underbelly of this ice sheet.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/281/5376/549] This same pattern of thinning is evident on the neighboring Thwaites Glacier. ===Further global warming ([[positive feedback]])=== Some effects of global warming themselves contribute directly to further global warming. ====Methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs==== {{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}} Climate scientists reported in August [[2005]] that a one million square kilometer region of [[permafrost]] [[peat bog]]s in western [[Siberia]] is starting to melt for the first time since it was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last [[ice age]]. This will release [[methane]], an extremely effective greenhouse gas, possibly as much as 70,000 million [[tonne]]s, over the next few decades. An earlier report in May [[2005]] reported similar melting in eastern [[Siberia]] [http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=56&ItemID=8482]. This [[positive feedback]] was not known about in [[2001]] when the [[IPCC]] issued its last major report on climate change. The discovery of permafrost peat bogs melting in 2005 implies that warming is likely to happen faster than was predicted in 2001. ====Methane release from hydrates==== {{main|Clathrate Gun Hypothesis}} [[Methane clathrate]], also called methane hydrate, is a form of [[water (molecule)|water]] [[ice]] that contains a large amount of [[methane]] within its [[crystal]] structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits has been hypothesized{{citation required}} as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additonal 5°{{citation required}} in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect availiable oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed{{citation required}} to explain the first mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. ==== Carbon cycle feedbacks ==== There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/full/408184a0_fs.html]. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude [[taiga|boreal forests]] of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular ([[HadCM3]]) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,965721,00.html]. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming. Observations show that soils in England have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years [http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1565050,00.html] according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year).[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7056/full/437205a.html] ====Forest Fires==== Rising Global temperature might cause forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming. ==Consequences== ''See also [[Mitigation of global warming]]'' === Economic === In commenting overall economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor Robert O. Mendelsohn of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that :""A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004). These new studies imply that impacts depend heavily upon initial temperatures (latitude). Countries in the polar region are likely to receive large benefits from warming, countries in the mid-latitudes will at first benefit and only begin to be harmed if temperatures rise above 2.5C (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Summing these regional impacts across the globe implies that warming benefits and damages will likely offset each other until warming passes 2.5C and even then it will be far smaller on net than originally thought (Mendelsohn and Williams 2004)."" [http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=165] ==== Decline of agriculture ==== {{main|Global warming and agriculture}} For some time it was hoped that a positive effect of global warming would be increased agricultural yields, because of the role of carbon dioxide in [[photosynthesis]], especially in preventing [[photorespiration]], which is responsible for significant destruction of several crops. In [[Iceland]], rising temperatures have made possible the widespread sowing of [[barley]], which was untenable twenty years ago. Some of the warming is due to a local (possibly temporary) effect via ocean currents from the Caribbean, which has also affected fish stocks [http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517939,00.html]. While local benefits may be felt in some regions (such as [[Siberia]]), recent evidence is that global yields will be negatively affected. ""Rising atmospheric temperatures, longer droughts and side-effects of both, such as higher levels of ground-level ozone gas, are likely to bring about a substantial reduction in crop yields in the coming decades, large-scale experiments have shown"" (''[[The Independent]]'', [[April 27]], 2005, ""Climate change poses threat to food supply, scientists say"" - report on [http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/event.asp?id=2844 this event]). Moreover, the region likely to be worst affected is [[Africa]], both because its geography makes it particularly vulnerable, and because seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Tanzania's official report on climate change suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less. The net result is expected to be that 33% less maize&mdash;the country's staple crop&mdash;will be grown [http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517935,00.html]. ====Insurance==== An industry very directly affected by the risks is the [[insurance]] industry; the number of major natural disasters has trebled since the 1960s, and insured losses increased fifteen-fold in real terms (adjusted for inflation) [http://www.aaisonline.com/communications/Climate%20Change.pdf]. According to one study, 35&ndash;40% of the worst catastrophes have been climate change related (ERM, 2002). Over the past three decades, the proportion of the global population affected by weather-related disasters has doubled in linear trend, rising from roughly 2% in 1975 to 4% in 2001 (ERM, 2002). A [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf June 2004 report] by the Association of British Insurers declared ""Climate change is not a remote issue for future generations to deal with. It is, in various forms, here already, impacting on insurers' businesses now"". It noted that weather risks for households and property were already increasing by 2-4 % per year due to changing weather, and that claims for storm and flood damages in the UK had doubled to over £6 billion over the period 1998&ndash;2003, compared to the previous five years. The results are rising insurance premiums, and the risk that in some areas [[flood risk insurance]] will become unaffordable for some. In the United States, insurance losses have also greatly increased, but according to one study those increases are attributed to increased population and property values in vulnerable coastal areas.(''Science'', '''284''', 1943-1947). ====Transport==== Roads, airport runways, railway lines and pipelines, (including [[oil pipeline]]s, [[sewer]]s, [[water main]]s etc) may require increased maintenance and renewal as they become subject to greater temperature variation, and, in areas with [[permafrost]], subject to [[subsidence]] [http://www.airportbusiness.com/article/article.jsp?id=2258&siteSection=4]. ====Flood defense==== For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the coast, and the cost of building better [[coastal defenses]] (due to the rising sea level) is likely to be considerable. Some countries will be more affected than others - low-lying countries such as [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Netherlands]] would be worst hit by any sea level rise, in terms of [[floods]] or the cost of preventing them. In developing countries, the poorest often live on flood plains, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as dykes and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings or access to credit needed to recover from disasters [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/ESSD/envext.nsf/46ParentDoc/ClimateChange?Opendocument]. ====Migration==== Some [[Pacific Ocean]] island nations, such as [[Tuvalu]], are concerned about the possibility of an eventual evacuation, as flood defense may become economically inviable for them. Tuvalu already has an ad hoc agreement with [[New Zealand]] to allow phased relocation [http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1063181,00.html]. In the 1990s a variety of estimates placed the number of [[environmental refugee]]s at around 25 million. (Environmental refugees are not included in the official definition of [[refugee]]s, which only includes migrants fleeing persecution.) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which advises the world’s governments under the auspices of the UN, estimated that 150 million environmental refugees will exist in the year 2050, due mainly to the effects of coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and agricultural disruption. (150 million means 1.5 percent of 2050’s predicted 10 billion world population.)[http://www.risingtide.nl/greenpepper/envracism/refugees.html] ====Northwest Passage==== [[Image:Arctic Ice Thickness.gif|250px|right]] Melting [[Arctic]] ice may open the [[Northwest Passage]] in summer, which would cut 5,000 [[nautical mile]]s (9,000 km) from shipping routes between Europe and Asia. This would be of particular relevance for supertankers which are too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and currently have to go around the tip of South America. According the Canadian Ice Service, the amount of ice in Canada's eastern Arctic Archipelago decreased by 15 percent between 1969 and 2004 [http://www.washingtontimes.com/specialreport/20050612-123835-3711r.htm]. While the reduction of summer ice in the Arctic may be a boon to shipping, this same phenomenon threatens the Arctic ecosystem, most notably polar bears which depend on ice floes. Subsistence hunters such as the Inuit peoples will find their livelihoods and cultures increasingly threatened as the ecosystem changes due to global warming. ====Development==== The combined effects of global warming may impact particularly harshly on people and countries without the resources to [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] those effects. This may slow [[economic development]] and [[poverty reduction]], and make it harder to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] [http://www.odi.org.uk/iedg/publications/climate_change_web.pdf], [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/story.jsp?story=648282]. In October 2004 the [[Working Group on Climate Change and Development]], a coalition of development and environment [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, issued a report [http://www.iied.org/docs/climate/Up_in_Smoke.pdf Up in Smoke] on the effects of climate change on development. This report, and the [[July 2005]] report [http://www.iied.org/pubs/pdf/full/9560IIED.pdf Africa - Up in Smoke?] predicted increased hunger and disease due to decreased rainfall and severe weather events, particularly in [[Africa]]. These are likely to have severe impacts on development for those affected. === Environmental === Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; reduced snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems may change; some [[species]] may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Increasing carbon dioxide may (up to a point) increase ecosystems' productivity; but the interaction with other aspects of [[climate change]], means the environmental impact of this is unclear. An increase in the total amount of [[biomass]] produced is not necessarily all good, since [[biodiversity]] can still decrease even though a smaller number of species are flourishing. ====Water scarcity==== Eustatic sea level rises threaten to contaminate [[groundwater]], affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones. Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it - leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply [http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp]. Higher temperatures will also increase the demand for water for cooling purposes. In the [[Sahel]], there has been on average a 25 per cent decrease in annual rainfall over the past 30 years. === Health === ==== Direct effects of temperature rise ==== Rising temperatures have two opposing direct effects on [[mortality]]: higher temperatures in winter reduce deaths from cold; higher temperatures in summer increase heat-related deaths. The distribution of these changes obviously differs. Palutikof et al calculate that in England and Wales for a 1 °C temperature rise the reduced deaths from cold outweigh the increased deaths from heat, resulting in a reduction in annual average mortality of 7000. The [[European heat wave of 2003]] killed 22,000&ndash;35,000 people, based on normal [[mortality]] rates (Schär and Jendritzky, 2004). It can be said with 90% confidence that past human influence on climate was responsible for at least half the risk of the 2003 European summer heat-wave (Stott et al 2004). If average temperatures increase by 1 degree Celsius, there will be an estimated 24,000 additional murders in the U.S. each year (as the additional heat stress leads to more frequent rage). (New Scientist 11/5/02, review of ''Body Heat'' by Mark Blumberg.) ==== Spread of disease ==== Global warming is expected to extend the favourable zones for [[Vector (biology)|vectors]] conveying [[infectious disease]] such as [[malaria]] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517940,00.html]. In poorer countries, this may simply lead to higher incidence of such diseases. In richer countries, where such diseases have been eliminated or kept in check by [[vaccination]], draining swamps and using pesticides, the consequences may be felt more in economic than health terms, if greater spending on preventative measures is required [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol6no1/reiter.htm]. ===Impacts of glacier retreat=== The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different impacts. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref_harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower. Many species of freshwater and saltwater plants and animals are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure a cold water habitat that they have adapted to. Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with [[Salmon]] and [[Cutthroat trout]]. Reduced glacier runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive. Ocean [[krill]], a cornerstone species, prefer cold water and are the primary food source for aquatic mammals such as the [[Sperm whale]].{{ref_harv|peck|CBS|CBS}} Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the worlds oceans, may impact existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well. The potential for major [[sea level rise]] is mostly dependent on a significant melting of the polar ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as this is where the vast majority of glacial ice is located. The [[British Antarctic Survey]] has determined from climate modeling that for at least the next 50 years, snowfall on the continent of Antarctica should continue to exceed glacial losses from global warming. The amount of glacial loss on the continent of Antarctica is not increasing significantly, and it is not known if the continent will experience a warming or a cooling trend, although the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] has warmed in recent years, causing glacier retreat in that region.{{ref_harv|BAS|BAS|BAS}} If all the ice on the polar ice caps were to melt away, the oceans of the world would rise an estimated 70&nbsp;m (229&nbsp;ft). However, with little major melt expected in Antarctica, sea level rise of not more than 0.5&nbsp;m (1.6&nbsp;ft) is expected through the 21st century, with an average annual rise of 0.0004&nbsp;m (0.0013&nbsp;ft) per year. [[Thermal expansion]] of the world's oceans will contribute, independent of glacial melt, enough to double those figures.{{ref_harv|sea|NSIDC2|NSIDC2}}

Columns: [{{See|Global warming}} [[Image:Risks and Impacts of Global Warming.png|thumb|right|350px| The net impact of global warming so far has been modest, but near-future effects are likely to become significantly negative, with large-scale extreme impacts possible by the end of the century.]] The predicted effects for [[the environment]] and for [[civilization|human life]] are numerous and varied. The main effect is an increasing global average temperature. From this flow a variety of resulting effects, namely, rising sea levels, altered patterns of [[agriculture]], increased [[extreme weather]] events, and the expansion of the range of tropical diseases. In some cases, the effects may already be occurring, although it is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term [[global warming]]. A summary of possible effects and our current understanding can be found in the report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) Working Group II;<ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/index.htm</ref> a discussion of projected climate changes is found in Working Group I.<ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/364.htm</ref> The more recent [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] outlines the latest agreed international thinking. Scientific and business groups in individual countries are also producing reports on the effects of global warming on their nation, such as in [[Effects of global warming on Australia|Australia]]. Proposed responses to the effects of global warming include [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]]. ==Overview== Projected climate changes due to [[global warming]] have the potential to lead to future large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in our climate resulting in impacts at continental and global scales. Examples of projected climate changes include: * significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, * large reductions in the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets, * accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial biosphere, and * releases of terrestrial carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments. The likelihood, magnitude, and timing of many of these changes is uncertain. However, the probability of one or more of these changes occurring is likely to increase with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change. Additionally, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] has warned, ""greenhouse warming and other human alterations of the earth system may increase the possibility of large, abrupt, and unwelcome regional or global climatic events. . . . Future abrupt changes cannot be predicted with confidence, and climate surprises are to be expected.""<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10136&page=1 |title= Executive Summary |accessdate=2007-05-07 |format= [[PHP]] |work= Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises |publisher= [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] |month= June |year= 2002}}</ref> It is not possible to be certain whether there will be any positive benefits of global warming. What is known is that some significant negative impacts are projected, and that these projections drive most of the concern about global warming, as well as attempts to mitigate it or adapt to its effects. Most scientists agree, however, that the negative effects will outweigh the positive effects.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Most of the consequences of global warming would result from one of three physical changes: sea level rise, higher local temperatures, and changes in rainfall patterns. Sea level is generally expected to [[sea level rise|rise]] 18-59 cm by the end of the century.<ref name=""WGI AR4 SPM"">{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | title=Summary for Policymakers | work=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Extratropical storms partly depend on the [[temperature gradient]], which is predicted to weaken in the northern hemisphere as the polar region warms more than the rest of the hemisphere <ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/366.htm</ref>. ===More extreme weather=== [[Image:Hurricane Intensity Shift.png|thumb|right|250px|This image shows the conclusions of Knutson and Tuleya (2004) that maximum intensity reached by tropical storms is likely to undergo an increase, with a significant increase in the number of highly destructive category 5 storms.]] Storm strength leading to [[extreme weather]] is increasing, such as the [[power dissipation index]] of hurricane intensity<ref>http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=181</ref>. [ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/NATURE03906.pdf Kerry Emmanuel in ''Nature''] writes that hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with temperature, reflecting global warming. Hurricane modeling has produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, are more intense than under present-day conditions; there is less confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of hurricanes. Worldwide, the proportion of [[hurricane]]s reaching [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|categories 4 or 5]] – with wind speeds above 56 metres per second – has risen from 20% in the 1970s to 35% in the 1990s.<ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8002</ref> Precipitation hitting the US from hurricanes increased by 7% over the twentieth century <ref>http://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/mg18625054.800</ref>.

(The extent to which this is due to global warming as opposed to the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] is unclear.) Some studies have found that the increase in sea surface temperature may be offset by an increase in wind shear, leading to little or no change in hurricane activity[http://www.livescience.com/environment/070417_wind_shear.html]. Catastrophes resulting from [[extreme weather]] are exacerbated by increasing population densities. The [[World Meteorological Organization]][http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0703-05.htm] and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://yosemite.epa.gov/OAR/globalwarming.nsf/webprintview/ActionsIndustryInsurance.html] have linked increasing extreme weather events to global warming, as have Hoyos ''et al.'' (2006), writing that the increasing number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes is directly linked to increasing temperatures.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1123560v1] [[Thomas Knutson]] and Robert E. Tuleya of the [[NOAA]] stated in 2004 that warming induced by [[greenhouse gas]] may lead to increasing occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms.[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/reference/bibliography/2004/tk0401.pdf] Vecchi and Soden find that [[wind shear]], the increase of which acts to inhibit [[tropical cyclones]], also changes in model-projections of global warming. There are projected increases of [[wind shear]] in the tropical Atlantic and East Pacific associated with the deceleration of the [[Walker circulation]], as well as decreases of wind shear in the western and central Pacific[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~gav/ipcc_shears.html]. The study does not make claims about the net effect on Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes of the warming and moistening atmospheres, and the model-projected increases in Atlantic wind shear. <ref>{{cite journal |last= Vecchi |first= Gabriel A. |coauthors= Brian J.

However, the evidence is clear that severe weather and moderate rainfall are also increasing. Stephen Mwakifwamba, national co-ordinator of the Centre for Energy, Environment, Science and Technology - which prepared the Tanzanian government's climate change report to the UN - says that change is happening in [[Tanzania]] right now. ""In the past, we had a drought about every 10 years"", he says. ""Now we just don't know when they will come. They are more frequent, but then so are floods. The climate is far less predictable. We might have floods in May or droughts every three years. Upland areas, which were never affected by mosquitoes, now are. Water levels are decreasing every day. The rains come at the wrong time for farmers and it is leading to many problems""<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517935,00.html</ref>. Greg Holland, director of the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Boulder, Colorado, said on April 24, 2006, ""The hurricanes we are seeing are indeed a direct result of climate change,"" and that the wind and warmer water conditions that fuel storms when they form in the Caribbean are, ""increasingly due to greenhouse gases. There seems to be no other conclusion you can logically draw."" Holland said, ""The large bulk of the scientific community say what we are seeing now is linked directly to greenhouse gases."" <ref>http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/04/25/global.warming.hurricanes.reut/index.html</ref> (See also ""Global warming?"" in [[tropical cyclone]]) ====Increased evaporation==== [[Image:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|350px|Increasing water vapor at Boulder, Colorado.]] Over the course of the 20th century, evaporation rates have reduced worldwide <ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v377/n6551/abs/377687b0.html</ref>; this is thought by many to be explained by [[global dimming]]. As the climate grows warmer and the causes of global dimming are reduced, [[evaporation]] will increase due to warmer oceans. Because the world is a closed system this will cause heavier [[rainfall]] and more [[erosion]]. This erosion, in turn, can in vulnerable tropical areas (especially in Africa) lead to [[desertification]] due to [[tropical deforestation|deforestation]]. On the other hand, in other areas, increased rainfall lead to growth of forests in dry desert areas. Many scientists think that increased evaporation could result in more extreme [[weather]] as global warming progresses. The IPCC Third Annual Report says: ""...global average water vapor concentration and precipitation are projected to increase during the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes and [[Antarctica]] in winter. At low latitudes there are both regional increases and decreases over land areas. Larger year to year variations in precipitation are very likely over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected"" <ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm</ref> <ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/364.htm</ref>. ====Cost of more extreme weather==== It's predicted that each 1% increase in annual precipitation would enlarge the cost of catastrophic storms by 2.8%<ref>Choi and Fisher, writing in ''Climate Change,'' vol. 58 (2003) pp. 149</ref> The Association of British Insurers has stated that limiting carbon emissions would avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s. The cost is also increasing partly because of building in exposed areas such as coasts and floodplains. The ABI claims that reduction of the vulnerability to some inevitable impacts of climate change, for example through more resilient buildings and improved ﬂood defences, could also result in considerable cost-savings in the longterm.<ref>http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf</ref> ====Destabilization of local climates==== [[Image:Cyclone Catarina 2004.jpg|thumbnail|The first recorded South Atlantic hurricane, [[Cyclone Catarina|""Catarina""]], which hit Brazil in March 2004]] In the northern hemisphere, the southern part of the [[Arctic]] region (home to 4,000,000 people) has experienced a temperature rise 1&nbsp;°C to 3&nbsp;°C (1.8&nbsp;°F to 5.4&nbsp;°F) over the last 50 years.

This may disrupt ecosystems and by increasing bacterial activity in the soil lead to these areas becoming carbon sources instead of [[carbon sink]]s <ref>http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_romanovsky.html</ref>. A study (published in ''Science'') of changes to eastern [[Siberia]]'s [[permafrost]] suggests that it is gradually disappearing in the southern regions, leading to the loss of nearly 11% of Siberia's nearly 11,000 lakes since 1971 <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1503170,00.html</ref>. At the same time, western Siberia is at the initial stage where melting permafrost is creating new lakes, which will eventually start disappearing as in the east. Furthermore, permafrost melting will eventually cause [[Effects of global warming#Methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs|methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs]]. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricane]]s were thought to be an entirely North Atlantic phenomenon. In late March 2004, the first [[Cyclone Catarina|Atlantic cyclone]] to form south of the [[equator]] hit [[Brazil]] with 40 m/s (144 km/h) winds, although some Brazilian meteorologists deny that it was a hurricane.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2004-03-28-brazil-storm_x.htm</ref> Monitoring systems may have to be extended 1,600 km (1,000 miles) further south.

An increase of 1.5 to 4.5 °C is estimated to lead to an increase of 15 to 95 cm (IPCC 2001). The sea level has risen more than 120 [[metre]]s since the peak of the last [[ice age]] about 18,000 years ago. The bulk of that occurred before 6000 years ago. From 3000 years ago to the start of the 19th century, sea level was almost constant, rising at 0.1 to 0.2 [[Millimetre|mm]]/yr; since 1900, the level has risen at 1&ndash;2 mm/yr <ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/425.htm</ref>; since [[1992]], [[satellite]] altimetry from [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] indicates a rate of about 3 mm/yr <ref>http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/426.htm</ref>. ''[[The Independent]]'' reported in December 2006 that the first island claimed by rising sea levels caused by global warming was [[Lohachara Island]] in the [[Sundarbans]] in [[Bay of Bengal]]. Lohachara was home to 10,000.<ref>http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article2099971.ece</ref> Earlier reports suggested that it was permanently flooded in the 1980s due to a variety of causes<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=207343 Kolkata Newsline – 22 yrs after deluge, they fear more] [[October 31]], 2006</ref>, that other islands were also affected and that the population in the Sundarbans had more than tripled to over 4 million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3102948.stm BBC - Fears rise for sinking Sundarbans] [[15 September]] 2003</ref> ====Temperature rise==== The temperature of the Antarctic [[Southern Ocean]] rose by 0.17 °C (0.31 °F) between the 1950s and the 1980s, nearly twice the rate for the world's oceans as a whole <ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5558/1275?ijkey=nFvdOLNYlMNZU&keytype=ref&siteid=sci</ref>. As well as effects on ecosystems (e.g. by melting sea ice, affecting algae that grow on its underside), warming could reduce the ocean's ability to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. More important for the [[United States]] may be the temperature rise in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As hurricanes cross the warm [[Loop Current]] coming up from [[South America]], they can gain great strength in under a day (as did [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005), with water above 85 °F seemingly promoting Category 5 storms. Hurricane season ends in November as the waters cool. ====Acidification==== {{main|Ocean acidification}} The world’s oceans soak up much of the carbon dioxide produced by living organisms, either as dissolved gas, or in the skeletons of tiny marine creatures that fall to the bottom to become chalk or limestone. Oceans currently absorb about one tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> per person per year. It is estimated that the oceans have absorbed around half of all CO<sub>2</sub> generated by human activities since 1800 (120,000,000,000 tonnes or 120 [[petagram]]s of carbon) <ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5682/367/DC1</ref>. But in water, carbon dioxide becomes a weak [[carbonic acid]], and the increase in the greenhouse gas since the [[industrial revolution]] has already lowered the average [[pH]] (the laboratory measure of acidity) of seawater by 0.1 units, to 8.2. Predicted emissions could lower it by a further 0.5 by 2100, to a level not seen for millions of years.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4633681.stm</ref> There are concerns that increasing acidification could have a particularly detrimental effect on [[coral]]s <ref>http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2558.jsp</ref> (16% of the world's coral reefs have died from bleaching caused by warm water in 1998, <ref>http://sun1.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/nhedinst/NATURE_416_389-395_2002.pdf</ref> which coincidentally was the warmest year ever recorded <ref>http://news.mongabay.com/2005/1216-weather.html</ref>) and other marine organisms with [[calcium carbonate]] shells <ref>http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/07/05/acidocean_pla.html</ref>. Increased acidity may also directly affect the growth and reproduction of fish as well as the [[plankton]] on which they rely for food <ref>http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article-6-129-2480.jsp</ref>. ====Shutdown of thermohaline circulation==== {{main|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} There is some speculation that global warming could, via a shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localized cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming, in that region. This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. More significantly, it could lead to an [[oceanic anoxic event]]. The chances of this near-term collapse of the circulation are unclear; there is some evidence for the short-term stability of the Gulf Stream and possible weakening of the North Atlantic drift. However, the degree of weakening, and whether it will be sufficient to shutdown the circulation, is under debate. There is, however, no evidence for cooling in northern Europe or nearby seas. At this point, temperature increases are the observations that have been directly made. ===Ecosystems=== Rising temperatures are beginning to have a noticeable impact on birds. Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; lessened snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also the [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems will change; some [[species]] are being forced out of their habitats ([[extinction risk from climate change|possibly to extinction]]) because of changing conditions, while others are flourishing. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Many of the species at risk are arctic and antarctic fauna such as [[Polar Bear|polar bears]] and emperor penguins. Species that rely on cold weather conditions such as [[gyrfalcon]]s, and [[snowy owl]]s that prey on lemmings that use the cold winter to their advantage will be hit hard.{{cn}} Marine invertebrates enjoy peak growth at the temperatures they have adapted to, regardless of how cold these may be, and [[cold-blooded]] animals found at greater [[latitude]]s and [[altitude]]s generally grow faster to compensate for the short growing season.<ref> {{cite journal |author=Arendt, J.D. |title=Adaptive intrinsic growth rates: an integration across taxa |year=1997 |journal=[[Q.

The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000 km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000 km² (7 million acres) annually. <ref>http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm</ref>. This change may be due in part to changes in forest management practices. Also note forest fires since 1997 in Indonesia. The fires are started to clear forest for agriculture. These occur from time to time and can set fire to the large peat bogs in that region. The CO<sub>2</sub> released by these peat bog fires has been estimated, in an average year, to release 15% of the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by fossil fuel combustion. <ref> BBC News: Asian peat fires add to warming [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm]</ref> Mechanistic studies have documented extinctions due to recent climate change: McLaughlin ''et al.'' documented two populations of [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] being threatened by precipitation change.<ref name=""McLaughlin""> {{cite journal |last= McLaughlin |first= John F. |coauthors= ''et al.'' |date= [[2002-04-30]] |title= Climate change hastens population extinctions |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 99 |issue= 9 |pages= 6070–6074 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.052131199 |url= http://www.nd.edu/~hellmann/pnas.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-03-29}} </ref> Parmesan states, ""Few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species""<ref> {{cite journal |last= Permesan |first= Camille |date= [[2006-08-24]] |title= Ecological and Evolutionary Responses to Recent Climate Change |journal= [[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume= 37 |pages= 637–669 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110100 |url= http://cns.utexas.edu/communications/File/AnnRev_CCimpacts2006.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-03-30}} </ref> and McLaughlin ''et al.'' agreed ""few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change.""<ref name=""McLaughlin""/> ====Ecological productivity==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect of improving ecosystems' productivity. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is rare in comparison to oxygen (less than 1% of air compared to 21% of air). This carbon dioxide starvation becomes apparent in [[photorespiration]], where there is so little carbon dioxide, that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and takes the place where carbon dioxide normally would be in the [[Calvin Cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, badly suppressing growth. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. ===Glacier retreat=== {{main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}} [[Image:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|300px|right|thumb|A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970. Thinning in orange and red, thickening in blue.]] [[Image:Lewist.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Lewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away]] In historic times, glaciers grew during the [[Little Ice Age]], a cool period from about 1550 to 1850. Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as climate warmed. [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|Glacier retreat]] declined and reversed, in many cases, from 1950 to 1980 as a slight global cooling occurred. Since 1980, glacier retreat has become increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that it has threatened the existence of many of the glaciers of the world. This process has increased markedly since 1995. <ref>http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/</ref> Excepting the [[ice cap]]s and [[ice sheet]]s of the Arctic and Antarctic, the total surface area of [[glacier]]s worldwide has decreased by 50% since the end of the 19th century <ref>http://www.munichre.com/pages/03/georisks/geo_climate/glaciers/glaciers_en.aspx</ref>. Currently glacier retreat rates and mass balance losses have been increasing in the Andes, Alps, Himalaya's, Rocky Mountains and North Cascades. As of March 2005, the snow cap that has covered the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] for the past 11,000 years since the last [[ice age]] has almost disappeared <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1437549,00.html</ref>. The loss of glaciers not only directly causes landslides, flash floods and [[glacial lake]] overflow<ref>http://www.rrcap.unep.org/issues/glof/</ref>, but also increases annual variation in water flows in rivers. Glacier runoff declines in the summer as glaciers decrease in size, this decline is already observable in several regions <ref>http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier.htm</ref>. Glaciers retain water on mountains in high precipitation years, since the snow cover accumulating on glaciers protects the ice from melting. In warmer and drier years, glaciers offset the lower precipitation amounts with a higher meltwater input <ref>http://www.munichre.com/pages/03/georisks/geo_climate/glaciers/glaciers_en.aspx</ref>. Of particular importance are the [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Himalaya]]n glacial melts that comprise the principal dry-season water source of many of the major rivers of the [[South Asia|South]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n mainland. Increased melting would cause greater flow for several decades, after which ""some areas of the most populated regions on Earth are likely to 'run out of water'"" as source glaciers are depleted. <ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04141.html</ref> The recession of mountain glaciers, notably in Western North America, Franz-Josef Land, Asia, the Alps, Indonesia and Africa, and tropical and sub-tropical regions of South America, has been used to provide qualitative support to the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century. Many glaciers are being lost to melting further raising concerns about future local water resources in these glacierized areas. The Lewis Glacier, North Cascades pictured at right after melting away in 1990 is one of the 47 North Cascade glaciers observed and all are retreating <ref>http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/</ref>. Despite their proximity and importance to human populations, the mountain and valley glaciers of temperate latitudes amount to a small fraction of glacial ice on the earth. About 99% is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar Antarctica and Greenland. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, 3 km (1.8 miles) or more in thickness, cap the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean. Glacier retreat has been observed in these outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate. In Greenland the period since the year 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched, Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, jointly drain more than 16% of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, retreating 7.2 km (4.5 miles) between 2001 and 2005. It has also accelerated from 20 m (65 ft)/day to 32 m (104 ft)/day.<ref>http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp</ref> [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] in west Greenland is generally considered the fastest moving glacier in the world. It had been moving continuously at speeds of over 24 m (78 ft)/day with a stable terminus since at least 1950. In 2002, the 12 km (7.5 mile) long floating terminus entered a phase of rapid retreat. The ice front started to break up and the floating terminus disintegrated accelerating to a retreat rate of over 30 m (98 ft)/day. The acceleration rate of retreat of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is even larger. Portions of the main trunk that were flowing at 15 m (49 ft)/day in 1988-2001 were flowing at 40 m (131 ft)/day in summer 2005. The front of the glacier has also retreated and has rapidly thinned by more than 100 m (328 ft).<ref>http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html</ref> Glacier retreat and acceleration is also apparent on two important outlet glaciers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Pine Island Glacier, which flows into the Amundsen Sea thinned 3.5 ± 0.9 m (11.5 ± 3 ft) per year and retreated five kilometers (3.1 miles) in 3.8 years. The [[Glacier terminus|terminus]] of the glacier is a floating ice shelf and the point at which it is afloat is retreating 1.2 km/year. This glacier drains a substantial portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and has been referred to as the weak underbelly of this ice sheet.<ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/281/5376/549</ref> This same pattern of thinning is evident on the neighboring Thwaites Glacier cliff. ===Further global warming (positive feedback)=== Some effects of global warming themselves contribute directly to further global warming. ====Methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs==== {{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}} Western Siberia is the world's largest [[peat bog]], and the melting of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of [[methane]], an extremely effective greenhouse gas, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions<ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725124.500</ref>. Climate scientists reported in August 2005 that a one million square kilometer region of [[permafrost]] [[peat bog]]s in western [[Siberia]] is starting to melt for the first time since it was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last [[ice age]]. This will release possibly as much as 70,000 million [[tonne]]s of methane over the next few decades. An earlier report in May 2005 reported similar melting in eastern [[Siberia]] <ref>http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=56&ItemID=8482</ref>. This [[positive feedback]] was not known about in 2001 when the [[IPCC]] issued its last major report on climate change. The discovery of permafrost peat bogs melting in 2005 implies that warming is likely to happen faster than was predicted in 2001. ====Methane release from hydrates==== {{main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}} [[Methane clathrate]], also called methane hydrate, is a form of [[water (molecule)|water]] [[ice]] that contains a large amount of [[methane]] within its [[crystal]] structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Positive_feedback_and_runaway_greenhouse_effect|runaway greenhouse effect]], has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. ====Carbon cycle feedbacks==== There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming <ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/full/408184a0_fs.html</ref>. All 11 models in the [[C4MIP]] study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO<sub>2</sub> varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean <ref>http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI3800.1</ref>. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude [[taiga|boreal forests]] of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular ([[HadCM3]]) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America <ref>http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,965721,00.html</ref>. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming. Observations show that soils in England have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1565050,00.html</ref> according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year).<ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7056/full/437205a.html</ref> ====Forest fires==== Rising global temperature might cause forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.<ref>{{cite web | title=Climate Change and Fire | publisher=[[David Suzuki Foundation]] | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Climate Roulette: Loss of Carbon Sinks & Positive Feedbacks | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=EcoBridge }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Global warming : Impacts : Forests | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=2000-01-07 | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Feedback Cycles: linking forests, climate and landuse activities | publisher=[[Woods Hole Research Center]] | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> ====Retreat of sea Ice==== The sea absorbs heat from the sun, while the ice largely reflects the sun rays back to space. Thus, retreating sea ice will allow the sun to warm the now exposed sea water, contributing to further warming. The mechanism is the same as when a black car heats up faster in sunlight than a white car. This [[albedo]] change is also the main reason why [[IPCC]] predict polar temperatures to rise up to twice as much as those of the rest of the world. ===Negative feedback effects=== Following [[Le Chatelier's principle]], the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's [[carbon cycle]] will shift in response to anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> via the so-called [[solubility pump]]. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries (Archer, 2005; ""A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever""). However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]]. Also, the [[thermal radiation]] of the Earth rises as the temperature to the fourth power. The impact of these negative feedback effects in relation to the positive feedback effects are part of [[IPCC]]'s [[global climate model]]s. ==Consequences== [[Image:Edccc.jpg|right|thumb|300px|As recent estimates of the rate of global warming have increased, so have the financial estimates of the damage costs.<ref>Adapted from a portion of Figure 1 in Tol and Yohe (2006) ""A Review of the Stern Review"" ''World Economics'' '''7'''(4): 233-50.</ref>]] {{seealso|Economics of global warming}} ===Economic=== Many estimates of aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe, the social cost of carbon (SCC), expressed in terms of future net benefits and costs that are discounted to the present, are now available. Peer-reviewed estimates of the SCC for 2005 have an average value of US$43 per tonne of carbon (tC) (i.e., US$12 per tonne of carbon dioxide) but the range around this mean is large. For example, in a survey of 100 estimates, the values ran from US$-10 per tonne of carbon (US$-3 per tonne of carbon dioxide) up to US$350/tC (US$95 per tonne of carbon dioxide.)<ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM13apr07.pdf 2007 IPCC Summary for Policymakers]</ref> In an [[October 29]] [[2006]], [[Stern Review]] by the former [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] and Senior Vice-President of the [[World Bank]] [[Nicholas Stern]], he states that climate change could affect [[Economic growth|growth]] which could be cut by one-fifth unless drastic action is taken. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096594.stm (''Report's stark warning on climate'')</ref> Stern has warned that one percent of global [[GDP]] is required to be invested in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk a [[recession]] worth up to twenty percent of global [[GDP]].<ref>BBC News (30 October 2006) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6098362.stm ""At-a-glance: The Stern Review""]</ref> Stern’s report<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_10_06_exec_sum.pdf |title=""Stern Review executive summary"" | author=Nicholas Stern | date=[[30 October]] [[2006]] | publisher=[[New Economics Foundation]]}}</ref> suggests that climate change threatens to be the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen.

In a 2004 comment on the economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that :""A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004). These new studies imply that impacts depend heavily upon initial temperatures (latitude). Countries in the polar region are likely to receive large benefits from warming, countries in the mid-latitudes will at first benefit and only begin to be harmed if temperatures rise above 2.5C (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Summing these regional impacts across the globe implies that warming benefits and damages will likely offset each other until warming passes 2.5C and even then it will be far smaller on net than originally thought (Mendelsohn and Williams 2004).""<ref>http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=165</ref> ====Effects on agriculture==== {{main|Global warming and agriculture}} For some time it was hoped that a positive effect of global warming would be increased agricultural yields, because of the role of carbon dioxide in [[photosynthesis]], especially in preventing [[photorespiration]], which is responsible for significant destruction of several crops. In [[Iceland]], rising temperatures have made possible the widespread sowing of [[barley]], which was untenable twenty years ago. Some of the warming is due to a local (possibly temporary) effect via ocean currents from the Caribbean, which has also affected fish stocks.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517939,00.html</ref> While local benefits may be felt in some regions (such as [[Siberia]]), recent evidence is that global yields will be negatively affected. ""Rising atmospheric temperatures, longer droughts and side-effects of both, such as higher levels of ground-level ozone gas, are likely to bring about a substantial reduction in crop yields in the coming decades, large-scale experiments have shown"" <ref>''[[The Independent]]'', [[April 27]], 2005, ""Climate change poses threat to food supply, scientists say"" - report on [http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/event.asp?id=2844 this event]</ref>. Moreover, the region likely to be worst affected is [[Africa]], both because its geography makes it particularly vulnerable, and because seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Tanzania's official report on climate change suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less. The net result is expected to be that 33% less maize&mdash;the country's staple crop&mdash;will be grown.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517935,00.html</ref> ====Insurance==== An industry very directly affected by the risks is the [[insurance]] industry; the number of major natural disasters has trebled since the 1960s, and insured losses increased fifteen-fold in real terms (adjusted for inflation).<ref>[[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf ]]</ref> According to one study, 35&ndash;40% of the worst catastrophes have been climate change related. Over the past three decades, the proportion of the global population affected by weather-related disasters has doubled in linear trend, rising from roughly 2% in 1975 to 4% in 2001. <ref> www.odi.org.uk: Climate change (html version) [http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:fiFPaQwpYD8J:www.odi.org.uk/iedg/publications/climate_change_web.pdf+%22ERM,+2002%22+%22climate+change%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us]</ref> According to a 2005 report from the Association of British Insurers, limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s.<ref>Association of British Insurers (2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf ""Financial Risks of Climate Change""] summary report</ref> A June 2004 report by the Association of British Insurers declared ""Climate change is not a remote issue for future generations to deal with. It is, in various forms, here already, impacting on insurers' businesses now.""<ref>Association of British Insurers (June 2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf ""A Changing Climate for Insurance:] A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers""</ref> It noted that weather risks for households and property were already increasing by 2-4 % per year due to changing weather, and that claims for storm and flood damages in the UK had doubled to over £6 billion over the period 1998&ndash;2003, compared to the previous five years. The results are rising insurance premiums, and the risk that in some areas [[flood insurance]] will become unaffordable for some. Financial institutions, including the world's two largest insurance companies, [[Munich Re]] and [[Swiss Re]], warned in a 2002 study that ""the increasing frequency of severe climatic events, coupled with social trends"" could cost almost [[U.S. dollar|US$]]150 billion each year in the next decade.<ref>UNEP (2002) [http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/CEO_briefing_climate_change_2002_en.pdf ""Key findings of UNEP’s Finance Initiatives study""] ''CEObriefing''</ref> These costs would, through increased costs related to insurance and disaster relief, burden customers, taxpayers, and industry alike. In the United States, insurance losses have also greatly increased. According to Choi and Fisher (2003) each 1% increase in annual precipitation could enlarge catastrophe loss by as much as 2.8%.<ref>Choi, O. and Fisher, A.

Regions already adversely affected include areas of [[permafrost]], which are subject to high levels of [[subsidence]], resulting in buckling roads, sunken foundations, and severely cracked runways. <ref>http://www.airportbusiness.com/article/article.jsp?id=2258&siteSection=4</ref> ====Flood defense==== For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the coast, and the cost of building better [[coastal defenses]] (due to the rising sea level) is likely to be considerable. Some countries will be more affected than others &mdash; low-lying countries such as [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Netherlands]] would be worst hit by any sea level rise, in terms of [[floods]] or the cost of preventing them. In developing countries, the poorest often live on flood plains, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as dykes and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.<ref>http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/ESSD/envext.nsf/46ParentDoc/ClimateChange?Opendocument</ref> ====Migration==== Some [[Pacific Ocean]] island nations, such as [[Tuvalu]], are concerned about the possibility of an eventual evacuation, as flood defense may become economically inviable for them. Tuvalu already has an ad hoc agreement with [[New Zealand]] to allow phased relocation.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1063181,00.html</ref> In the 1990s a variety of estimates placed the number of [[environmental refugee]]s at around 25 million. (Environmental refugees are not included in the official definition of [[refugee]]s, which only includes migrants fleeing persecution.) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which advises the world’s governments under the auspices of the UN, estimated that 150 million environmental refugees will exist in the year 2050, due mainly to the effects of coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and agricultural disruption (150 million means 1.5% of 2050’s predicted 10 billion [[world population]]).<ref>http://www.risingtide.nl/greenpepper/envracism/refugees.html</ref><ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20050223042051/http://www.risingtide.nl/greenpepper/envracism/refugees.html</ref> ====Northwest Passage==== [[Image:Arctic Ice Thickness.gif|250px|right|thumb|Ice thicknesses changes from 1950s to 2050s simulated in one of [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory|GFDL]]'s R30 atmosphere-ocean [[general circulation model]] experiments]] Melting [[Arctic]] ice may open the [[Northwest Passage]] in summer, which would cut 5,000 [[nautical mile]]s (9,000 km) from shipping routes between Europe and Asia. This would be of particular relevance for [[Supertanker|supertankers]] which are too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and currently have to go around the tip of South America. According to the [[Canadian Ice Service]], the amount of ice in Canada's eastern [[Arctic Archipelago]] decreased by 15% between 1969 and 2004.<ref>http://www.washingtontimes.com/specialreport/20050612-123835-3711r.htm</ref> While the reduction of summer ice in the Arctic may be a boon to shipping, this same phenomenon threatens the Arctic ecosystem, most notably polar bears which depend on ice floes. Subsistence hunters such as the [[Inuit]] peoples will find their livelihoods and cultures increasingly threatened as the ecosystem changes due to global warming. ====Development==== The combined effects of global warming may impact particularly harshly on people and countries without the resources to [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] those effects. This may slow [[economic development]] and [[poverty reduction]], and make it harder to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref>http://www.odi.org.uk/iedg/publications/climate_change_web.pdf</ref><ref>http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/story.jsp?story=648282</ref> In October 2004 the [[Working Group on Climate Change and Development]], a coalition of development and environment [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, issued a report [http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=9512IIED Up in Smoke] on the effects of climate change on development. This report, and the July 2005 report [http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=9560IIED Africa - Up in Smoke?] predicted increased hunger and disease due to decreased rainfall and severe weather events, particularly in [[Africa]]. These are likely to have severe impacts on development for those affected. ===Environmental=== Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; reduced snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems may change; some [[species]] may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Increasing carbon dioxide may increase ecosystems' productivity to a point. Ecosystems' unpredictable interactions with other aspects of [[climate change]] makes the possible environmental impact of this is unclear, though. An increase in the total amount of [[biomass]] produced may not be necessarily positive: [[biodiversity]] can still decrease even though a relatively small number of species are flourishing. ====Water scarcity==== Positive eustasy may contaminate [[groundwater]], affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones. Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it, leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply.<ref>http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp</ref> Higher temperatures will also increase the demand for water for the purposes of cooling and hydration. In the [[Sahel]], there has been on average a 25% decrease in annual rainfall over the past 30 years. ====Mountains==== [[Mountains]] cover approximately 25 percent of earth's surface and provide a home to more than one-tenth of global human population. Changes in global climate poses a number of potential risks to mountain habitats. Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of [[forest fires]], the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of water. Studies suggest that a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/potential_effects.pdf</ref> Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses.<ref>http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/UNEP114.doc.html</ref> ===Health=== ====Direct effects of temperature rise==== The most direct effect of climate change would be the impacts of hotter temperatures themselves. Extreme high temperatures increase the number of people who die on a given day for many reasons: people with heart problems are vulnerable because one's cardiovascular system must work harder to keep the body cool during hot weather, heat exhaustion, and some respiratory problems increase. Higher air temperature also increase the concentration of ozone at ground level. In the lower atmosphere, ozone is a harmful polluntant. It damages lung tissues and causes problems for people with asthmas other lung diseases. <ref>McMichael, A.J., Campbell-Lendrum, D.H., Corvalán, C.F., Ebi, K.L., Githeko, A., Scheraga, J.D. and Woodward, A. 322pp.</ref> Rising temperatures have two opposing direct effects on [[death|mortality]]: higher temperatures in winter reduce deaths from cold; higher temperatures in summer increase heat-related deaths. The distribution of these changes obviously differs. Palutikof et al calculate that in England and Wales for a 1 °C temperature rise the reduced deaths from cold outweigh the increased deaths from heat, resulting in a reduction in annual average mortality of 7000.

On April 15, 2007, the [[Military Advisory Board]], a panel of retired U.S. generals and admirals released a report entitled ""National Security and the Threat of Climate Change."" The report predicts that global warming will have significant security implications, in particular serving as a ""threat multiplier"" in already volatile regions.<ref>[http://securityandclimate.cna.org/report/ ""National Security and the Threat of Climate Change]"". Military Advisory Board, April 15, 2007.</ref> Just two days later, on April 17, the [[U.N. Security Council]] held a debate on the security implications of climate change, during which Britain's [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Margaret Beckett]] argued that “An unstable climate will exacerbate some of the core drivers of conflict, such as migratory pressures and competition for resources.”<ref>Reuters.

''Salon,'' April 9, 2007. Retrieved on May 29, 2007.</ref> ===Impacts of glacier retreat=== The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different impacts. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref_harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower. Many species of freshwater and saltwater plants and animals are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure a cold water habitat that they have adapted to. Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with [[Salmon]] and [[Cutthroat trout]]. Reduced glacier runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive. Ocean [[krill]], a cornerstone species, prefer cold water and are the primary food source for aquatic mammals such as the [[Blue whale]].{{ref_harv|peck|CBS|CBS}} Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the worlds oceans, may impact existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well. The potential for major [[sea level rise]] is mostly dependent on a significant melting of the polar ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as this is where the vast majority of glacial ice is located. The [[British Antarctic Survey]] has determined from climate modeling that for at least the next 50 years, snowfall on the continent of Antarctica should continue to exceed glacial losses from global warming. The amount of glacial loss on the continent of Antarctica is not increasing significantly, and it is not known if the continent will experience a warming or a cooling trend, although the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] has warmed in recent years, causing glacier retreat in that region.{{ref_harv|BAS|BAS|BAS}} If all the ice on the polar ice caps were to melt away, the oceans of the world would rise an estimated 70&nbsp;m (229&nbsp;ft). However, with little major melt expected in Antarctica, sea level rise of not more than 0.5&nbsp;m (1.6&nbsp;ft) is expected through the 21st century, with an average annual rise of 0.0004&nbsp;m (0.0013&nbsp;ft) per year. [[Thermal expansion]] of the world's oceans will contribute, independent of glacial melt, enough to double those figures.{{ref_harv|sea|NSIDC2|NSIDC2}} ==References== {{reflist}} <div class=""references-small""> * Archer, D.

It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent [[climate change]] may already be occurring. [[Sea level rise|Raising sea levels]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Arctic shrinkage]], and altered patterns of [[Climate change and agriculture|agriculture]] are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include [[extreme weather]] events, an expansion of [[tropical diseases]], [[phenology|changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems]], and drastic [[Economics of global warming|economic impact]]. Concerns have led to [[Politics of global warming|political]] activism advocating proposals to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]], [[zero-carbon|eliminate]], or [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt]] to it. The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects. ==Overview== Potential climate changes due to [[global warming]] may lead to future large-scale and possibly irreversible effects at continental and global scales. The likelihood, magnitude, and timing is uncertain and [[Global warming controversy|controversial]], but some examples of projected climate changes include significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], large reductions in the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]s, accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial [[biosphere]], and releases of terrestrial carbon from [[permafrost]] regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments. The probability of one or more of these changes occurring is likely to increase with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change. Additionally, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] has stated, ""greenhouse warming and other human alterations of the earth system may increase the possibility of large, abrupt, and unwelcome regional or global climatic events. . . . Future abrupt changes cannot be predicted with confidence, and climate surprises are to be expected.""<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10136&page=1 |title= Executive Summary |accessdate=2007-05-07 |format= [[PHP]] |work= Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises |publisher= [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] |month= June |year= 2002}}</ref> The IPCC reports that the effects of global warming will be mixed across regions. For smaller values of warming (1 to 3&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]), changes are expected to produce net benefits in some regions and for some activities, and net costs for others. Greater warming may produce net costs (or to reduce the benefits from smaller warming) in all regions.

As the climate grows warmer and the causes of global dimming are reduced, [[evaporation]] will increase due to warmer oceans. Because the world is a closed system this will cause heavier [[rainfall]], with more [[erosion]]. This erosion, in turn, can in vulnerable tropical areas (especially in Africa) lead to [[desertification]] due to [[tropical deforestation|deforestation]]. On the other hand, in other areas, increased rainfall lead to growth of forests in dry desert areas. Scientists have found evidence that increased evaporation could result in more extreme [[weather]] as global warming progresses. The IPCC Third Annual Report says: ""...global average water vapor concentration and precipitation are projected to increase during the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes and [[Antarctica]] in winter. At low latitudes there are both regional increases and decreases over land areas. Larger year to year variations in precipitation are very likely over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected.""<ref name=ar4wg1a/><ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] |editor=Houghton, J.T.,Y.

Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed. [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|Glacier retreat]] declined and reversed in many cases from 1950 to 1980 as a slight global cooling occurred.

Despite their proximity and importance to [[world population|human populations]], the mountain and valley glaciers of temperate latitudes amount to a small fraction of glacial ice on the earth. About 99% is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar Antarctica and Greenland. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, 3 km (1.8 miles) or more in thickness, cap the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean. [[Image:Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland]] Glacier retreat has been observed in these outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate. In [[Greenland]] the period since the year 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched, Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, jointly drain more than 16% of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]]. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, retreating 7.2 km (4.5 miles) between 2001 and 2005. It has also accelerated from 20 m (65 ft)/day to 32 m (104 ft)/day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp |title=Rapidly accelerating glaciers may increase how fast the sea level rises|author=Emily Saarman|publisher=UC Santa Cruz Currents |date= 2005-11-14 |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] in west Greenland is generally considered the fastest moving glacier in the world.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ====Sea level rise==== [[Image:Recent Sea Level Rise.png|right|thumb|300px|Sea level has been rising {{#expr: 20/120 round 1}} cm/year, based on measurements of [[sea level rise]] from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments]] {{main|Sea level rise}} With increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in glaciers, for example, the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s. An increase of 1.5 to 4.5 °C is estimated to lead to an increase of 15 to 95 cm (IPCC 2001). The sea level has risen more than 120 metres since the peak of the last [[ice age]] about 18,000 years ago. The bulk of that occurred before 6000 years ago. From 3000 years ago to the start of the 19th century, sea level was almost constant, rising at 0.1 to 0.2 [[Millimetre|mm]]/yr; since 1900, the level has risen at an average of 1.7 mm/yr <ref name=ar4wg1ch5>{{cite web |publisher= Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. |author=Bindoff, N.L., J.

This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. More significantly, it could lead to an [[oceanic anoxic event]]. The chances of this near-term collapse of the circulation are unclear; there is some evidence for the short-term stability of the Gulf Stream and possible weakening of the North Atlantic drift. However, the degree of weakening, and whether it will be sufficient to shut down the circulation, is under debate. As yet, no cooling has been found in northern Europe or nearby seas. ==Abrupt and irreversible effects== The scientific consensus in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that ""Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."" ====Abrupt effects==== Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land could imply metres of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation of low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and low-lying islands. Such changes are projected to occur over millennial time scales, but more rapid sea level rise on century time scales cannot be excluded.<ref>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group II Report ""Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"". Chapter 6: Coastal Systems and Low Lying Areas. http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter6.pdf</ref> ====Irreversible effects==== Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible effects. There is medium confidence that approximately 20- 30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5°C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5°C,model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe. At the scale of 7°C temperature increase, emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] caused by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] may cause by a severe [[anoxic event]]. This will adversely affect marine ecologies. ==Positive feedback effects== Some of the observed and potential effects of global warming are [[positive feedback]]s, contributing directly to further global warming. ====Methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs==== {{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}} Western Siberia is the world's largest [[peat bog]], a one million square kilometer region of [[permafrost]] peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last [[ice age]].

The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Positive feedback and runaway greenhouse effect|runaway greenhouse effect]], has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. ====Carbon cycle feedbacks==== There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/abs/408184a0.html |journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |title=Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model |first=Peter M. |last=Cox |coauthors=Richard A.

All 11 models in the [[C4MIP]] study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO<sub>2</sub> varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI3800.1 |journal=Journal of Climate |title=Climate–Carbon Cycle Feedback Analysis: Results from the C4MIP Model Intercomparison |volume=19 |number =14 |pages=3337–3353 |year=2006 | first=P. |last=Friedlingstein |coauthors= P.

The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude [[taiga|boreal forests]] of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular ([[HadCM3]]) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,965721,00.html |title=5.5C temperature rise in next century| publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-05-29|accessdate=2008-01-02}}</ref>. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming.

This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Forests/Forests_101/FIRE/Climate_Change.asp | title=Climate Change and Fire | publisher=[[David Suzuki Foundation]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/ImpactsForests.html | title=Global warming : Impacts : Forests | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=2000-01-07 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.whrc.org/southamerica/fire_savann/FeedbackCycles.htm | title= Feedback Cycles: linking forests, climate and landuse activities | publisher=[[Woods Hole Research Center]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> ====Retreat of sea ice==== [[Image:Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|right|thumb|Northern Hemisphere ice trends]] [[Image:Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|right|thumb|Southern Hemisphere ice trends]] The sea absorbs heat from the sun, while the ice largely reflects the sun rays back to space.

The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> via the so-called [[solubility pump]]. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: ""A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever""<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer|first=David|year=2005|title= Fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> in geologic time |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=110 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002625|pages= C09S05}} </ref>. However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]]. Also, the [[thermal radiation]] of the Earth rises in proportion to the fourth power of temperature, increasing the amount of outgoing radiation as the Earth warms. The impact of this negative feedback effect is included in [[global climate model]]s summarized by the [[IPCC]]. ==Other consequences== [[Image:Edccc.jpg|right|thumb|300px|As recent estimates of the rate of global warming have increased, so have the financial estimates of the damage costs.<ref>Adapted from a portion of Figure 1 in Tol and Yohe (2006) ""A Review of the Stern Review"" ''World Economics'' '''7'''(4): 233-50.</ref>]] ===Economic and social=== {{seealso|Economics of global warming}} Many estimates of aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe, the social cost of carbon (SCC), expressed in terms of future net benefits and costs that are discounted to the present, are now available.

In a 2004 comment on the economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that :""A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004). These new studies imply that impacts depend heavily upon initial temperatures (latitude). Countries in the polar region are likely to receive large benefits from warming, countries in the mid-latitudes will at first benefit and only begin to be harmed if temperatures rise above 2.5C (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Summing these regional impacts across the globe implies that warming benefits and damages will likely offset each other until warming passes 2.5C and even then it will be far smaller on net than originally thought (Mendelsohn and Williams 2004).""<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=165 |title=Opponent paper on climate change |publisher= Copenhagen Consensus 2004|author=Robert Mendelsohn |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> ====Insurance==== An industry very directly affected by the risks is the [[insurance]] industry; the number of major natural disasters has tripled since the 1960s, and insured losses increased fifteenfold in real terms (adjusted for inflation).<ref>[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf Viewpoint] American Association of Insurance Services</ref> According to one study, 35&ndash;40% of the worst catastrophes have been climate change related.

Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the worlds oceans, may affect existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well. ====Forests==== [[Image:Northern Forest Trend in Photosynthetic Activity.gif|thumb|250px|right]] Pine forests in [[British Columbia]] have been devastated by a [[pine beetle]] infestation, which has expanded unhindered since 1998 at least in part due to the lack of severe winters since that time; a few days of extreme cold kill most mountain pine beetles and have kept outbreaks in the past naturally contained. The infestation, which will have killed 50% of the lodgepole pines by 2008 <ref> [http://mpb.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index_e.html Natural Resources Canada] </ref> has passed to Alberta and will spread further East and eventually into America given continued milder winters. Besides the immediate ecological and economic impact, the huge dead forests provide a fire risk as well. Forests in some regions potentially face an increased risk of [[forest fire]]s. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000 km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000 km² (7 million acres) annually.<ref>[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change] Regional Paper: Alaska</ref>. This change may be due in part to changes in forest management practices. In the western U. S., since 1986, longer, warmer summers have resulted in a fourfold increase of major wildfires and a sixfold increase in the area of forest burned, compared to the period from 1970 to 1986. A similar increase in wildfire activity has been reported in Canada from 1920 to 1999.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/313/5789/927 Science Magazine - August 2006 ""Is Global Warming Causing More, Larger Wildfires?"" - Steven W.

Changes in global climate pose a number of potential risks to mountain habitats<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VFV-4MY0TS1-1&_user=4225319&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2007&_rdoc=12&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236020%232007%23999829996%23668309%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6020&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=17&_acct=C000048559&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4225319&md5=b28529ce89b28da5f49792dfebeef70b&errMsg=1 Exposure of global mountain systems to climate warming during the 21st Century] Science Direct</ref>. Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of [[forest fires]], the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of water. Studies suggest that a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/potential_effects.pdf The Potential Effects Of Global Climate Change On The United States] Report to Congress Editors: Joel B. Smith and Dennis Tirpak US-EPA December 1989</ref> Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Freshwater Issues at ‘Heart of Humankind’S Hopes for Peace and Development’ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2002-12-12]] | url = http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/ENVDEV713.doc.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> ====Ecological productivity==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect of improving ecosystems' productivity. In [[photorespiration]], carbon dioxide that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and take the place of carbon dioxide in the [[Calvin cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, suppressing growth. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations tend to reduce photorespiration. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. ===Environmental=== Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; reduced snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems may change; some [[species]] may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Increasing carbon dioxide may increase ecosystems' productivity to a point. Ecosystems' unpredictable interactions with other aspects of [[climate change]] makes the possible environmental impact of this is unclear, though. An increase in the total amount of [[biomass]] produced may not be necessarily positive: [[biodiversity]] can still decrease even though a relatively small number of species are flourishing. ====Water scarcity==== {{seealso|Water crisis}} Sea level rise is projected to increase salt-water intrusion into [[groundwater]] in some regions, affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/GlobalWarming.nsf/content/ResourceCenterPublicationsSeaLevelRiseIndex.html EPA : Global Warming : Resource Center : Publications : Sea Level Rise : Sea Level Rise Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it, leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp Kazakhstan: glaciers and geopolitics] ''Stephan Harrison'' Open Democracy May 2005</ref> The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref_harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower. Higher temperatures will also increase the demand for water for the purposes of cooling and hydration. In the [[Sahel]], there has been an unusually wet period from 1950 until 1970, followed by [[Sahel drought|extremely dry years]] from 1970 to 1990.

About 99% is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar Antarctica and Greenland. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=off}} or more in thickness, cap the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ==== Sea level rise ==== {{Double image stack|right|Holocene Sea Level.png|Recent Sea Level Rise.png|200|Sea leve rise during the Holocene.|Sea level has been rising {{#expr: 20/120 round 1}} cm/year, based on measurements of [[sea level rise]] from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments.}} {{main|Current sea level rise}} With increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in glaciers, for example, the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s.

Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Positive feedback and runaway greenhouse effect|runaway greenhouse effect]], has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. In 2008, a research expedition for the [[American Geophysical Union]] detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed [[permafrost]], around the outfall of the [[Lena River]] and the area between the [[Laptev Sea]] and [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/exclusive-the-methane-time-bomb-938932.html|title=Exclusive: The methane time bomb|last=Connor|first=Steve|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hundreds-of-methane-plumes-discovered-941456.html|title=Hundreds of methane 'plumes' discovered|last=Connor|first=Steve|date=September 25, 2008|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref><ref>N.

This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Forests/Forests_101/FIRE/Climate_Change.asp | title=Climate Change and Fire | publisher=[[David Suzuki Foundation]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/ImpactsForests.html | title=Global warming : Impacts : Forests | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=2000-01-07 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.whrc.org/southamerica/fire_savann/FeedbackCycles.htm | title= Feedback Cycles: linking forests, climate and landuse activities | publisher=[[Woods Hole Research Center]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the [[Amazon rainforest]], eventually resulting in a transition to [[Caatinga]] vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} ==== Retreat of sea ice ==== {{Double image stack|right|Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|200|Northern Hemisphere ice trends|Southern Hemisphere ice trends}} {{main|Arctic shrinkage|Ice-albedo feedback}} The sea absorbs heat from the sun, while the ice largely reflects the sun rays back to space.

One source of such [[aerosols]] is the [[sulfur cycle]], where [[plankton]] release gases such as [[DMS]] which eventually becomes [[oxidation|oxidised]] to [[sulfur dioxide]] in the atmosphere. Disruption to the oceans as a result of [[ocean acidification]] or disruptions to the [[thermohaline circulation]] may result in disruption of the [[sulfur cycle]], thus reducing its cooling effect on the planet through the creation of [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]]. == Negative feedback effects == {{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} {{Expand-section|date=December 2008}} Following [[Le Chatelier's principle]], the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's [[carbon cycle]] will shift in response to anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> via the so-called [[solubility pump]]. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: ""A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever""<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer|first=David|year=2005|title= Fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> in geologic time |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=110 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002625|pages= C09S05}} </ref>. However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]]. Also, the [[thermal radiation]] of the Earth rises in proportion to the fourth power of temperature, increasing the amount of outgoing radiation as the Earth warms. The impact of this negative feedback effect is included in [[global climate model]]s summarized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. == Other consequences == [[Image:Edccc.png|right|thumb|300px|As recent estimates of the rate of global warming have increased, so have the financial estimates of the damage costs]] === Economic and social === {{seealso|Economics of global warming}} The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report contains a review of the literature on the economics of climate change: <blockquote>Impacts of climate change are ''very likely'' to impose net annual costs, which will increase over time as global temperatures increase. Peer-reviewed estimates of the [[social cost of carbon]] [Net economic costs of damages from climate change [[aggregate data|aggregate]]d across the globe and [[social discount rate|discounted]] to the specified year] in 2005 average US$12 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>, but the range from 100 estimates is large (-$3 to $95/tCO<sub>2</sub>). This is due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding [[climate sensitivity]], response lags, the treatment of [[risk]] and [[equity (economics)|equity]], economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses and [[social discount rate|discount]] rates. Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions and populations and ''very likely'' underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf|title=""IPCC Summary for Policymakers, page 22.

In a 2004 comment on the economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that: {{quote|A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al. 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al. 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al. 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004).

Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al. 2000).

Besides the immediate ecological and economic impact, the huge dead forests provide a fire risk. Even many healthy forests appear to face an increased risk of [[forest fire]]s because of warming climates. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000&nbsp;km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000&nbsp;km² (7 million acres) annually.<ref>[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change] Regional Paper: Alaska</ref>.

Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of [[forest fires]], the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of water. Studies suggest that a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/potential_effects.pdf The Potential Effects Of Global Climate Change On The United States] Report to Congress Editors: Joel B. Smith and Dennis Tirpak US-EPA December 1989</ref> Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Freshwater Issues at ‘Heart of Humankind’S Hopes for Peace and Development’ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2002-12-12]] | url = http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/ENVDEV713.doc.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> ==== Ecological productivity ==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect of improving ecosystems' productivity. In [[photorespiration]], carbon dioxide that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and take the place of carbon dioxide in the [[Calvin cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, suppressing growth. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations tend to reduce photorespiration. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. === Water scarcity === {{seealso|Water crisis}} Sea level rise is projected to increase salt-water intrusion into [[groundwater]] in some regions, affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/GlobalWarming.nsf/content/ResourceCenterPublicationsSeaLevelRiseIndex.html EPA : Global Warming : Resource Center : Publications : Sea Level Rise : Sea Level Rise Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it, leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp Kazakhstan: glaciers and geopolitics] ''Stephan Harrison'' Open Democracy May 2005</ref> The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.

With greater levels of warming (greater than 2–3°C by 2100, relative to 1990 temperature levels), it is very likely that benefits will decline and costs increase (IPCC, 2007b:17). Low-[[latitude]] and less-developed areas are probably at the greatest risk from climate change (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:781).<ref name=schneider>{{cite book |author=Schneider, S.H., ''et al''. |chapter=Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|p=781}} }}</ref> With human systems, [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] potential for climate change impacts is considerable, although the costs of adaptation are largely unknown and potentially large. In a literature assessment, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would likely result in reduced diversity of ecosystems and the extinction of many species. ==Definition of climate change== This article refers to reports produced by the IPCC. In their usage, ""climate change"" refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties, and that persists for extended periods, typically decades or longer (IPCC, 2007d:30).<ref name=ar4syn/> The climate change referred to may be due to natural causes or the result of human activity. ==Physical impacts== {{Main|Physical impacts of climate change}} This section describes physical impacts of climate change. For some of these physical impacts, their effect on social and economic systems are also described. === Effects on weather === Increasing temperature is likely to lead to increasing precipitation <ref name=""ar4wg1a"">{{cite book |author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |authorlink=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |chapter=Summary for Policymakers: Human influences will continue to change atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=8}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., ''et al.'' |chapter=9.3.6.2 Precipitation and Convection |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/365.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=365}} }}</ref> but the effects on storms are less clear. Extratropical storms partly depend on the [[temperature gradient]], which is predicted to weaken in the northern hemisphere as the polar region warms more than the rest of the hemisphere.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., ''et al.'' |chapter=9.3.6.3 Extra-tropical storms |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/366.htm |editor={{harvnb|Houghton|2001|p=366}} }}</ref> ==== Extreme weather ==== {{See also|Extreme weather|Tropical cyclone#Global warming|List of Atlantic hurricane records}} IPCC (2007a:8) predicted that in the future, over most land areas, the frequency of warm spells or [[heat wave]]s would very likely increase.<ref name=ar4wg1 /> Other likely changes are listed below: *Increased areas will be affected by [[drought]] *There will be increased intense [[tropical cyclone]] activity *There will be increased incidences of extreme high sea level (excluding [[tsunami]]s) ==== Local climate change ==== {{Main|Regional effects of global warming}} [[Image:Cyclone Catarina 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The first recorded South Atlantic hurricane, [[Cyclone Catarina|""Catarina""]], which hit Brazil in March 2004]] Regional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere. The [[coast]] can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Biogeochemical cycles=== {{See also|climate change feedback}} Climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive ""feedback"" process . A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process. A positive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it (IPCC, 2007d:78).<ref name=ar4syn/> Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:792).<ref name=schneider/> Using the A2 SRES emissions scenario, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:789) found that this effect led to additional warming by 2100, relative to the 1990-2000 period, of 0.1 to 1.5 °C. This estimate was made with high confidence. The climate projections made in the IPCC Forth Assessment Report of 1.1 to 6.4 °C account for this feedback effect. On the other hand, with medium confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007) commented that additional releases of GHGs were possible from permafrost, peat lands, wetlands, and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes. ===Glacier retreat and disappearance=== {{Main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}} [[Image:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|250px|left|thumb|A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970. Thinning in orange and red, thickening in blue.]] IPCC (2007a:5) found that, on average, mountain glaciers and snow cover had decreased in both the northern and southern hemispheres.<ref name= ar4wg1 /> This widespread decrease in glaciers and ice caps has contributed to observed sea level rise. With very high or high confidence, IPCC (2007d:11) made a number of predictions relating to future changes in glaciers:<ref name=ar4syn>{{cite web |date=2007d |title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ====Acidification==== {{Main|Ocean acidification}} Dissolving {{chem|CO|2}} in seawater increases the [[hydrogen]] ion ({{chem|H|+}}) concentration in the ocean, and thus decreases ocean pH. [[Ken Caldeira|Caldeira]] and Wickett (2003) placed the rate and magnitude of modern ocean acidification changes in the context of probable historical changes during the last 300 million years.<ref name=caldeira>{{cite journal |author=Caldeira, K. and M.E.

IPCC (2007a) were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993 to 2003 was due to natural variations in sea level over the time period, or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term trend. IPCC (2007a:13, 14) projected sea level rise to the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century using the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] emission [[economics of global warming#Scenarios|scenarios]]. Across the six SRES marker scenarios, sea level was projected to rise by 18 to 59&nbsp;cm (7.1 to 23.2&nbsp;inches). This projection was for the time period 2090-2099, with the increase in level relative to average sea levels over the 1980-1999 period. Due to a lack of scientific understanding, this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets. ====Shutdown of thermohaline circulation==== {{Main|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} There is some speculation that global warming could, via a shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localized cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming, in that region.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1073/pnas.0705414105}}</ref> This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. IPCC (2007b:17) concluded that a slowing of the [[Thermohaline circulation|Meridional Overturning Circulation]] would very likely occur this century. Due to global warming, temperatures across the Atlantic and Europe were still projected to increase. ====Temperature rise==== From 1961 to 2003, the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10 °C from the surface to a depth of 700 m. There is variability both year-to-year and over longer time scales, with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 1991 to 2003, but some cooling from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bindoff, N.L., J.

''et al''. |chapter=Food, fibre and forest products |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch5.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=273–313}} }}</ref> In general, low-latitude areas are at most risk of having decreased crop yields (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:790).<ref name=schneider/> With low to medium confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:787) concluded that for about a 1 to 3°C global mean temperature increase (by 2100, relative to the 1990-2000 average level) there would be productivity decreases for some [[cereal]]s in low latitudes, and productivity increases in high latitudes. With medium confidence, global production potential was predicted to: *increase up to around 3°C, *very likely decrease above about 3 to 4°C. Most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:790) had not incorporated a number of critical factors, including changes in extreme events, or the spread of pests and diseases. Studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid adaptation. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.''., 2007:393).<ref>{{cite book |author=Confalonieri, U. ''et al''. |chapter=Human health |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=391–431}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Confalonieri ''et al.''. (2007:393), the effects of climate change to date have been small, but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions. With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''. (2007:393) concluded that climate change had altered the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species. With medium confidence, they concluded that climate change had: *altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors *increased heatwave-related deaths With high confidence, IPCC (2007d:48) projected that:<ref name=ar4syn/> *the health status of millions of people would be affected through, for example, increases in [[malnutrition]]; increased deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; increased burden of [[Diarrhea|diarrhoeal disease]]s; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to high concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change; and altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases. *climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in Africa. Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure. ====Specific health impacts==== {{POV-section|date=May 2010|Malaria}} {{Cleanup split|Climate change, industry and society|date=May 2010}} '''Malnutrition''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

Projected relative risks attributable to climate change in 2030 varied by health outcome and region. Risks were largely negative, with most of the projected disease burden due to increases in diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition. These increases were primarily in low-income populations already experiencing a large burden of disease. '''Extreme events''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase the number of people suffering from death, disease and injury from [[heatwave]]s, [[flood]]s, [[storm]]s, [[fire]]s and [[drought]]s.<ref name=wg2c8es/> ''Floods and weather disasters'' Floods are low-probability, high-impact events that can overwhelm physical infrastructure and human communities (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Confalonieri, U., B.

The impacts of weather disasters is considerable and unequally distributed. For example, natural disasters have been shown to result in increased domestic violence against - and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorders]] in – [[women]]. In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors. High-density populations in low-lying coastal regions experience a high health burden from weather disasters. ''Heatwaves'' Hot days, hot nights and heatwaves have become more frequent (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-1.html ""8.2.1.1 Heatwaves""]</ref> Heatwaves are associated with marked short-term increases in mortality. For example, in August 2003, a heatwave in Europe resulted in excess mortality in the range of 35,000 total deaths. Heat-related morbidity and mortality is projected to increase (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-3.html ""8.4.1.3 Heat- and cold-related mortality""]</ref> The health burden could be relatively small for moderate heatwaves in temperate regions, because deaths occur primarily in susceptible persons. ''Drought'' The effects of drought on health include deaths, malnutrition, [[infectious disease]]s and [[respiratory disease]]s (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s823/> Countries within the ""[[Meningitis]] Belt"" in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]] and [[epidemic]] frequency of [[meningococcal disease|meningococcal]] meningitis in Africa, although other areas in the Rift Valley, the Great Lakes, and southern Africa are also affected (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-3-1.html ""8.2.3.1 Drought and infectious disease""]</ref> The spatial distribution, intensity, and seasonality of meningococcal (epidemic) meningitis appear to be strongly linked to climate and environmental factors, particularly drought. The cause of this link is not fully understood. ''Fires'' In some regions, changes in temperature and precipitation are projected to increase the frequency and severity of fire events (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-6-3.html ""8.2.6.3 Air pollutants from forest fires""]</ref> Forest and bush fires cause burns, damage from smoke inhalation and other injuries. '''Infectious disease vectors''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would continue to change the range of some [[infectious disease]] vectors.<ref name=wg2c8es/> [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector-borne diseases]] (VBD) are infections transmitted by the bite of infected [[arthropod]] species, such as [[mosquito]]es, [[tick]]s, [[triatominae|triatomine]] bugs, [[sandfly|sandflies]], and [[Black fly|blackflies]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Confalonieri, U., B.

Climate change has also been implicated in changes in the breeding and migration dates of several bird species. Several species of wild bird can act as carriers of human [[pathogen]]s as well as of vectors of infectious agents. ''Dengue'' It is possible<sup>d</sup> that climate change will increase the number of people at risk of dengue (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> Based on the expert judgement of Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007), this projection had about a two-in-ten chance of being correct. [[dengue fever|Dengue]] is the world's most important vector-borne viral disease (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Confalonieri, U., B. Menne, R. Akhtar, K.L.

The effects of observed climate change on the geographical distribution of malaria and its transmission intensity in highland regions remains controversial. There is no clear evidence that malaria has been affected by climate change in South America or in continental regions of the Russian Federation. There is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales. {{Undue|paragraph|date=May 2010}} A paper by researchers from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Florida]] published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in May 2010 concluded that claims that a warming climate has led to more widespread disease and death due to malaria are largely at odds with the evidence, and that ""''predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.''""<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Climate change and the global malaria recession|author=Peter W.

(2007) projected that, particularly in Africa, climate change would be associated with geographical expansions of the areas suitable for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in some regions, and contractions in other regions. Projections also suggested that some regions would experience a longer season of transmission. Projections suggested expansions in vector species that carry dengue for parts of Australia and New Zealand. '''Diarrhoeal diseases''' With medium confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases.<ref name=wg2c8es/> Childhood mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains high (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-5.html ""8.2.5 Water and disease""]</ref> This is despite improvements in care. Several studies have shown that transmission of [[intestine|enteric]] pathogens is higher during the rainy season. Some studies have found that higher temperature was strongly associated with increased episodes of diarrhoeal disease in adults and children in Peru. The WHO study, referred to earlier, projected that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income regions by approximately 2 to 5% in 2020 (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8411/> '''Ground-level ozone''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality associated with ground-level [[ozone]].<ref name=wg2c8es/> Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and is the primary constituent of urban [[smog]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-6.html ""8.2.6 Air quality and disease""]</ref> Ozone in smog is formed through chemical reactions involving [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other compounds. The reaction is a [[photochemical reaction]], meaning that it involves [[electromagnetic radiation]], and occurs in the presence of bright sunshine and high temperatures. Exposure to elevated concentrations of ozone is associated with increased hospital admissions for [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], allergic [[rhinitis]] and other respiratory diseases, and with premature mortality. Background levels of ground-level ozone have risen since pre-industrial times because of increasing emissions of methane, [[carbon monoxide]] and nitrogen oxides (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-4.html ""8.4.1.4 Urban air quality""]</ref> This trend is expected to continue into the mid-21<sup>st</sup> century. '''Cold-waves''' It is expected that<sup>b</sup> climate change will bring some health benefits (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> It is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by negative climate change effects. [[cold wave|Cold-waves]] continue to be a problem in northern latitudes, where very low temperatures can be reached in a few hours and extend over long periods (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-1-2.html ""8.2.1.2 Cold-waves""]</ref> Reductions in cold-deaths due to climate change are projected to be greater than increases in heat-related deaths in the UK (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8413/> ===Water resources=== {{See also|Water crisis}} In a literature assessment, Kundzewicz ''et al.''. (2007:175) concluded, with high confidence, that:<ref>{{cite book |author=Kundzewicz Z.W. ''et al''. |chapter=Freshwater resources and their management |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch3.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=173–210}} }}</ref> *the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. All of the regions assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic), and small islands) showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. *Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater. With very high confidence, it was judged that many of these areas, e.g., the Mediterranean basin, western USA, southern Africa, and north-eastern Brazil, would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. ===Migration and conflict=== An argument can be made that rising ethnic conflicts may be linked to competition over natural resources that are increasingly scarce as a result of climate change (Wilbanks ''et al.''., 2007:365).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wilbanks, T.J. ''et al''. |chapter=Industry, settlement and society |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch7.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=357–390}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Wilbanks ''et al.''. (2007:365), other factors need to be taken into account. It was suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa have more to do with the relative abundance of resources, e.g., oil and diamonds, than with resource scarcity. On this basis, Wilbanks ''et al.''. (2007:365) suggested that predictions of future conflicts due climate change should be viewed with caution. With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:787) predicted that stresses such as increased drought, water shortages, and riverine and coastal flooding would affect many local and regional populations.<ref name=schneider/> With medium confidence, it was predicted that these stresses would lead, in some cases, to relocation within or between countries. This might have the effect of exacerbating conflicts, and possibly impose migration pressures. Zhang ''et al'' also concluded that climate change drives conflict.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0703073104}}</ref> ===Aggregate impacts=== {{Main|Economics of global warming}} Aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007d:76).<ref name=ar4syn/> The impacts of climate change across world population will not be distributed evenly (Smith ''et al.'', 2001:957).<ref name=smith/> IPCC (2007b:17) found that for increases in global mean temperature of less than 1-3 °C above 1990 levels, some impacts were projected to produce benefits in some places and sectors, and produce costs in other places and sectors.<ref name=ar4wg2/> For some low-latitude and polar regions, net costs were projected for small increases in temperature. According to IPCC (2007b:17), a temperature increase of greater than about 2-3 °C would very likely result in all regions either experiencing reductions in net benefits or increases in net costs. ==Regions== Some regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change (IPCC, 2007d:9):<ref name=ar4syn/> *The Arctic, because of high rates of projected warming. *Africa, especially in the sub-Saharan region. This is due to the continent's low capacity to adapt to climate change and projected impacts. *Small islands, due to high exposure of population and infrastructure at risk to sea-level rise and increased storm surge. *Asian megadeltas, due to large populations and high exposure to sea-level rise, storm surge and river flooding. Within other areas, some people are particularly at risk, such as the poor, young children and the elderly. ==Biological systems== {{Main|Climate change and ecosystems}} {{See also|Extinction risk from global warming|Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity|Effects of climate change on marine mammals}} With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded that regional temperature trends were already affecting species and ecosystems around the world.<ref name=schneider/> In a literature assessment, Rosenzweig ''et al.''. (2007:81) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernable influence on many physical and biological systems.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rosenzweig, C. ''et al''. |chapter=Assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch1.html |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=79–131}} }}</ref> Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of ecosystems. *'''Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity''': With a warming of 3°C, relative to 1990 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider ''et al.''., 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4°C (above the 1990-2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe. *'''Marine ecosystems and biodiversity''': With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:792) concluded that a warming of 2°C above 1990 levels would result in mass mortality of coral reefs globally. *'''Freshwater ecosystems''': Above about a 4°C increase in global mean temperature by 2100 (relative to 1990-2000), Schneider ''et al.''. (2007:789) concluded, with high confidence, that many freshwater species would become extinct. ==Footnotes== The IPCC report that is referred to in this article uses specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty (Ahmad ''et al.'', 2001).<ref>{{cite book |year=2001 |author=Ahmad, Q.K. and R.A.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current| currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming, with greater temperature increases over land and in [[polar region]]s rather than over the oceans.<ref>{{cite book |author={{harvnb|Staudt|2008}} |page=6}}</ref> Using models, it is possible to identify the human ""signal"" of global warming over both land and ocean areas. Projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale.<ref>{{cite book |author={{harvnb|Staudt|2008}} |page=9}} </ref> It is, however, expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already, with greatest warming over land and high northern [[latitude]]s, and least over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |contribution=Projections of Future Changes in Climate |series=Summary for Policymakers |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Solomon|2007}} }}</ref> ===Biogeochemical cycles=== {{See also|climate change feedback}} Climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive {{q |feedback}} process. A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of {{chem|CO|2}} have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess {{chem|CO|2}}. The ocean have also acted as a sink in absorbing extra heat from the atmosphere. This extra heat has been added to the climate system due to the build-up of GHGs.

However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. According to Easterling ''et al.'' (2007), [[sub-Saharan Africa]] will likely surpass [[Asia]] as the most food-insecure region. This projection was largely independent of climate change and mostly the result of projected social and economic development. Easterling ''et al.'' (2007) pointed to the large potential benefits of [[climate change mitigation]] (i.e., reducing GHG emissions) on the agriculture sector. It was suggested that these benefits might only become apparent in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref>{{cite book |author=Confalonieri, U.

(2007:393), the effects of climate change to date have been small, but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions. With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that climate change had altered the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species. With medium confidence, they concluded that climate change had: *altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors *increased heatwave-related deaths With high confidence, IPCC (2007d:48) projected that:<ref name=ar4syn/> *the health status of millions of people would be affected through, for example, increases in [[malnutrition]]; increased deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; increased burden of [[Diarrhea|diarrhoeal disease]]s; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to high concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change; and altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases. *climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in Africa. Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure. ====Specific health impacts==== {{POV-section|date=May 2010|Malaria}} {{Cleanup split|Climate change, industry and society|date=May 2010}} '''Malnutrition''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors.

(2007) projected that, particularly in Africa, climate change would be associated with geographical expansions of the areas suitable for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in some regions, and contractions in other regions. Projections also suggested that some regions would experience a longer season of transmission. Projections suggested expansions in vector species that carry dengue for parts of Australia and New Zealand. '''Diarrhoeal diseases''' With medium confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases.<ref name=wg2c8es/> Childhood mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains high (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-5.html ""8.2.5 Water and disease""]</ref> This is despite improvements in care. Several studies have shown that transmission of [[intestine|enteric]] pathogens is higher during the rainy season. Some studies have found that higher temperature was strongly associated with increased episodes of diarrhoeal disease in adults and children in Peru. The WHO study, referred to earlier, projected that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income regions by approximately 2 to 5% in 2020 (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2s8411/> '''Ground-level ozone''' With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality associated with ground-level [[ozone]].<ref name=wg2c8es/> Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and is the primary constituent of urban [[smog]] (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-2-6.html ""8.2.6 Air quality and disease""]</ref> Ozone in smog is formed through chemical reactions involving [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other compounds. The reaction is a [[photochemical reaction]], meaning that it involves [[electromagnetic radiation]], and occurs in the presence of bright sunshine and high temperatures. Exposure to elevated concentrations of ozone is associated with increased hospital admissions for [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], allergic [[rhinitis]] and other respiratory diseases, and with premature mortality. Background levels of ground-level ozone have risen since pre-industrial times because of increasing emissions of methane, [[carbon monoxide]] and nitrogen oxides (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-4-1-4.html ""8.4.1.4 Urban air quality""]</ref> This trend is expected to continue into the mid-21<sup>st</sup> century. '''Cold-waves''' It is expected that<sup>b</sup> climate change will bring some health benefits (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=wg2c8es/> It is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by negative climate change effects.

(2007:175) concluded, with high confidence, that:<ref>{{cite book |author=Kundzewicz ZW ''et al'' |chapter=Freshwater resources and their management |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch3.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=173–210}} }}</ref> *the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. All of the regions assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic), and small islands) showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. *Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater. With very high confidence, it was judged that many of these areas, e.g., the Mediterranean basin, western USA, southern Africa, and north-eastern Brazil, would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. ===Migration and conflict=== An argument can be made that rising ethnic conflicts may be linked to competition over natural resources that are increasingly scarce as a result of climate change (Wilbanks ''et al.'', 2007:365).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wilbanks, TJ ''et al'' |chapter=Industry, settlement and society |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch7.html | publisher = IPCC | location = CH |editor={{harvnb|Parry|2007|pp=357–90}} }}</ref> According to a literature assessment by Wilbanks ''et al.'' (2007:365), other factors need to be taken into account. It was suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa have more to do with the relative abundance of resources, e.g., oil and diamonds, than with resource scarcity. On this basis, Wilbanks ''et al.'' (2007:365) suggested that predictions of future conflicts due climate change should be viewed with caution. With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:787) predicted that stresses such as increased drought, water shortages, and riverine and coastal flooding would affect many local and regional populations.<ref name = schneider /> With medium confidence, it was predicted that these stresses would lead, in some cases, to relocation within or between countries. This might have the effect of exacerbating conflicts, and possibly impose migration pressures.

According to the IPCC (2007b:17), a temperature increase of greater than about 2–3°C would very likely result in all regions either experiencing reductions in net benefits or increases in net costs. ==Regions== Some regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change (IPCC, 2007d:9):<ref name=ar4syn/> *The Arctic, because of high rates of projected warming. *Africa, especially in the sub-Saharan region. This is due to the continent's low capacity to adapt to climate change and projected impacts. *Small islands, due to high exposure of population and infrastructure at risk to sea-level rise and increased storm surge. *Asian megadeltas, due to large populations and high exposure to sea-level rise, storm surge and river flooding. Within other areas, some people are particularly at risk, such as the poor, young children and the elderly. ==Biological systems== {{Main|Climate change and ecosystems}} {{See also|Extinction risk from global warming|Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity|Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals|Effects of climate change on marine mammals}} With very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.''

(2007:792) concluded, with high confidence, that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of ecosystems. * '''Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity''': with a warming of 3°C, relative to 1990 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider ''et al.'', 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4°C (above the 1990–2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe. * '''Marine ecosystems and biodiversity''': with very high confidence, Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:792) concluded that a warming of 2°C above 1990 levels would result in mass mortality of coral reefs globally. * '''Freshwater ecosystems''': above about a 4°C increase in global mean temperature by 2100 (relative to 1990–2000), Schneider ''et al.'' (2007:789) concluded, with high confidence, that many freshwater species would become extinct. ==Abrupt or irreversible changes== ===Abrupt climate change=== [[Abrupt climate change]] is defined as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems (CCSP, 2008a).<ref>{{cite book |year=2008a |author=CCSP |title=Abrupt Climate Change: Summary and Findings (Brochure).

Predictions of such a change are highly uncertain due to a lack of scientific understanding. Modeling of the processes associated with a rapid ice sheet and glacier change could potentially increase future projections of sea level rise. ===The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation=== {{See also|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}} The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an important component of the Earth's climate system, characterized by a northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic and a southward flow of colder water in the deep Atlantic (CCSP, 2008b, p.&nbsp;5).<ref>{{cite book |year=2008b |author=CCSP |title=Abrupt Climate Change.

Warming is still expected to occur over most of the European region downstream of the North Atlantic Current in response to increasing greenhouse gases, as well as over North America. Although it is very unlikely that the AMOC will collapse in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe. ===Irreversibilities=== An irreversible change is one where that change, once set in motion, cannot be reversed, at least over some specified timescale, e.g., centuries to millennia (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;22).<ref>{{cite book |year=1996 |author=Goldemberg, J.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ===Health=== Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref name=""health summary""/> According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri ''et al.''

Climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3% of [[diarrhoea]], 3% of [[malaria]], and 3.8% of [[dengue fever]] deaths worldwide in 2004. Total attributable mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were child deaths. ====Projections==== With high confidence, authors of the IPCC AR4 Synthesis report<ref name=""IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report""/>{{Rp|48}} projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in [[Africa]].

A Report by the U.S. [[Climate Change Science Program]] and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research |publisher= National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |location= Washington D.C., USA. |pages= 19–20; 27–28 |url= http://www.globalchange.gov/publications/reports/scientific-assessments/saps/311 }} Tables 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 27-28 show two quantitative scales of uncertainty which are used in the TAR and AR4.</ref> and reflect the expert judgement of IPCC authors. In this formulation, probability is not only a function of an event, but also the state of information that is available to the person making the assessment.<ref name=""US CCSP report on uncertainty""/> In this framework, assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes available.<ref name=""US CCSP report on uncertainty""/> The IPCC also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event occurring.<ref name=""ipcc ar4 uncertainty""/> This is different from the confidence scales described above, and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood. For example, the judgement that an event is improbable (e.g., rolling a [[dice]] twice and getting a six both times) may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence.<ref name=""ipcc ar4 uncertainty""/> Also, the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring (e.g., a tossed [[coin]] coming up heads) may also be assigned a high level of confidence.<ref name=""ipcc ar4 uncertainty""/> == Notes == {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} <!-- Please cite these in the text if they are being used as sources, per relevant policies and guidelines. --> ==References== *{{cite book | year=2010 | title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change | publisher=[http://www.nap.edu The National Academies Press] | location=Washington, D.C. | author=America’s Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change, Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, Division on Earth and Life Studies, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782 | isbn=978-0-309-14588-6 | ref=CITEREFNRC2010 }} *{{cite book | year = 2008 | title = Ecological Impacts of Climate Change | publisher = The National Academies Press | location = 500 Fifth Street, NW Washington, DC 20001, USA | author = Commitee on Ecological Impacts of Climate Change, US National Research Council (NRC) | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12491 | isbn = 978-0-309-12710-3 | ref=CITEREFNRC2008b }} * {{Citation |year = 1996 |author = IPCC SAR WG2 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 1995: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses |series = Contribution of Working Group II to the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = Watson, R.T.; Zinyowera, M.C.; and Moss, R.H. |publisher = Cambridge University Press |url = http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/publications/SAR/index.html |isbn = 0-521-56431-X }} (pb: {{ISBNT|0-521-56437-9}} [http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_II/ipcc_sar_wg_II_full_report.pdf pdf]. * {{Citation |year = 2001 |author = IPCC TAR WG1 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |series = Contribution of Working Group I to the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = Houghton, J.T.; Ding, Y.; Griggs, D.J.; Noguer, M.; van der Linden, P.J.; Dai, X.; Maskell, K.; and Johnson, C.A. |publisher = Cambridge University Press |url = http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/index.htm |isbn = 0-521-80767-0 }} (pb: {{ISBNT|0-521-01495-6}}). * {{Citation |year = 2001 |author = IPCC TAR WG2 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability |series = Contribution of Working Group II to the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = McCarthy, J.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.''

For example, the judgement that an event is improbable (e.g., rolling a [[dice]] twice and getting a six both times) may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence.<ref name=""ipcc ar4 uncertainty""/> Also, the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring (e.g., a tossed [[coin]] coming up heads) may also be assigned a high level of confidence.<ref name=""ipcc ar4 uncertainty""/> == Notes == {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} <!-- Please cite these in the text if they are being used as sources, per relevant policies and guidelines. --> ==References== *{{cite book | year=2010 | title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change | publisher=[http://www.nap.edu The National Academies Press] | location=Washington, D.C. | author=America’s Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change, Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, Division on Earth and Life Studies, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782 | isbn=978-0-309-14588-6 | ref=CITEREFNRC2010 }} *{{cite book | year = 2008 | title = Ecological Impacts of Climate Change | publisher = The National Academies Press | location = 500 Fifth Street, NW Washington, DC 20001, USA | author = Committee on Ecological Impacts of Climate Change, US National Research Council (NRC) | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12491 | isbn = 978-0-309-12710-3 | ref=CITEREFNRC2008b }} * {{Citation |year = 1996 |author = IPCC SAR WG2 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 1995: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses |series = Contribution of Working Group II to the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = Watson, R.T.; Zinyowera, M.C.; and Moss, R.H. |publisher = Cambridge University Press |url = http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/publications/SAR/index.html |isbn = 0-521-56431-X }} (pb: {{ISBNT|0-521-56437-9}} [http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_II/ipcc_sar_wg_II_full_report.pdf pdf]. * {{Citation |year = 2001 |author = IPCC TAR WG1 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |series = Contribution of Working Group I to the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = Houghton, J.T.; Ding, Y.; Griggs, D.J.; Noguer, M.; van der Linden, P.J.; Dai, X.; Maskell, K.; and Johnson, C.A. |publisher = Cambridge University Press |url = http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/index.htm |isbn = 0-521-80767-0 }} (pb: {{ISBNT|0-521-01495-6}}). * {{Citation |year = 2001 |author = IPCC TAR WG2 |author-link = IPCC |title = Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability |series = Contribution of Working Group II to the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor = McCarthy, J.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=""rosenzweig observed impacts""/> concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases. Impacts include earlier leafing of [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s over many regions; movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; changes in [[bird migration]]s in Europe, North America and Australia; and shifting of the oceans' [[plankton]] and [[fish]] from cold- to warm-adapted communities.<ref name=""nasa briefs""/> The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming, with greater temperature increases over land and in [[polar region]]s rather than over the oceans.<ref name=""nrc 2008 climate change brochure""> {{cite book | year=2008 | title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/wcc.81}}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature11575}}</ref> Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.049}}</ref> Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1108/09653561111161752}}</ref> ===Health=== {{Main|Effects of global warming on human health}} Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref name=""health summary""> {{citation |author = Confalonieri ''et al.'' |chapter = Chapter 8: Human health |chapter-url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html |at= [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-es.html Executive summary] }}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}. </ref> According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri ''et al.''

Not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates, for example, the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded. Climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3% of [[diarrhoea]], 3% of [[malaria]], and 3.8% of [[dengue fever]] deaths worldwide in 2004. Total attributable mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were child deaths. ====Projections==== With high confidence, authors of the IPCC AR4 Synthesis report<ref name=""IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report""/>{{Rp|48|date=November 2012}} projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in [[Africa]].

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.''

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/wcc.81}}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature11575}}</ref> Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.049}}</ref> Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1108/09653561111161752}}</ref> ===Health=== {{Main|Effects of global warming on human health}} Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref name=""health summary""> {{citation |author = Confalonieri ''et al.'' |chapter = Chapter 8: Human health |chapter-url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html |at= [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-es.html Executive summary] }}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}. </ref> According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri ''et al.''

Not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates, for example, the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded. Climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3% of [[diarrhoea]], 3% of [[malaria]], and 3.8% of [[dengue fever]] deaths worldwide in 2004. Total attributable mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were child deaths. ====Projections==== With high confidence, authors of the IPCC AR4 Synthesis report<ref name=""IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report""/>{{Rp|48|date=November 2012}} projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of [[malaria]] in [[Africa]]. Benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=""health summary""/>{{Rp|393|date=November 2012}} concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=""rosenzweig observed impacts""/> concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dai | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1002/wcc.81 | title = Drought under global warming: A review | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change | volume = 2 | pages = 45–65 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11575| title = Little change in global drought over the past 60 years| journal = Nature| volume = 491| issue = 7424| pages = 435–438| year = 2012| last1 = Sheffield | first1 = J. | last2 = Wood | first2 = E.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=""rosenzweig observed impacts""/> concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases. Impacts include earlier leafing of [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s over many regions; movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; changes in [[bird migration]]s in Europe, North America and Australia; and shifting of the oceans' [[plankton]] and [[fish]] from cold- to warm-adapted communities.<ref name=""nasa briefs""/> The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming, with greater temperature increases over land and in [[polar region]]s rather than over the oceans.<ref name=""nrc 2008 climate change brochure""> {{cite book | year=2008 | title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dai | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1002/wcc.81 | title = Drought under global warming: A review | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change | volume = 2 | pages = 45–65 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11575| title = Little change in global drought over the past 60 years| journal = Nature| volume = 491| issue = 7424| pages = 435–438| year = 2012| last1 = Sheffield | first1 = J. | last2 = Wood | first2 = E.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560–700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100–240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dai | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1002/wcc.81 | title = Drought under global warming: A review | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change | volume = 2 | pages = 45–65 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11575| title = Little change in global drought over the past 60 years| journal = Nature| volume = 491| issue = 7424| pages = 435–438| year = 2012| last1 = Sheffield | first1 = J. | last2 = Wood | first2 = E.

Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560–700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100–240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dai | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1002/wcc.81 | title = Drought under global warming: A review | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change | volume = 2 | pages = 45–65 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11575| title = Little change in global drought over the past 60 years| journal = Nature| volume = 491| issue = 7424| pages = 435–438| year = 2012| last1 = Sheffield | first1 = J. | last2 = Wood | first2 = E.

Excessive precipitation patterns lead to excessive sediment deposition, nutrient pollution, and concentration of minerals in aquifers. The rising global temperature will cause sea level rise and will extend areas of [[Salinity|salinization]] of [[groundwater]] and [[estuary|estuaries]], resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. The exposure of rising sea level will push the salt gradient into freshwater deposits and will eventually pollute freshwater sources. In an assessment of the [[scientific literature]], Kundzewicz ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=""freshwater impacts""/> concluded, with high confidence, that: * the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. All of the regions assessed in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] ([[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Polar region]]s ([[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]), and small islands) showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater aquifers become minerally concentrated due to the accelerated precipitation patterns and aquifers not adequately storing freshwater. * [[semi-arid climate|Semi-arid]] and [[arid]] areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater. With very high confidence, it was judged that many of these areas, e.g., the [[Mediterranean basin]], [[Western United States]], [[Southern Africa]], and north-eastern [[Brazil]], would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. '''Technological Freshwater Uses:''' Freshwater has become an aiding factor for industrialization in this modern era. It has many uses other than drinking including: domestic use, irrigation, livestock, aquaculture, industrial, mining, public supply, and thermoelectric. These are only some of the general uses of freshwater that further complicate freshwater quality. These components take a large quantity of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] to implement into technology. For a reference, measured in million gallons per day, public use accounts for roughly 44,000&nbsp;mg/pd, Domestic use 4,000&nbsp;mg/pd, Irrigation 128,000&nbsp;mg/pd, livestock 2,140&nbsp;mg/pd, aquaculture 8,780&nbsp;mg/pd, industrial 17,000&nbsp;mg/pd, mining 2,310&nbsp;mg/pd, and finally [[Thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric]] 143,000&nbsp;mg/pd. The amount of freshwater being allocated towards technology results for about half of the natural freshwater resource that is actually available to us. With all of these different factors using the freshwater resource that accounts for less than one percent it should be of concern. Current water energy regulations are being made to switch to less energy intensive processes. In turn, lowering water use has a direct link with energy use, significantly lowering amount of emissions. reason being that there is a water-energy nexus and that they work in synergy. Water is needed to produce energy while energy is needed to ""produce"" water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/downloads/water-energy-nexus-challenges-and-opportunities|title=The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> Examining this relationship can significantly lower greenhouse emissions, resulting in slower rates of climate change. ===Migration and conflict=== {{Main|Environmental migrant|Climate security}} [[global climate model|General circulation models]] project that the future climate change will bring wetter coasts, drier mid-continent areas, and further sea level rise.<ref name=""sar migration""> {{citation |author= Scott |chapter= Chapter 12: Human settlements in a changing climate: impacts and adaptation |at= Sec. 12.3.1 Population Migration |display-authors=etal}}, pp. 406–407, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG2|1996}}. </ref> Such changes could result in the gravest effects of climate change through [[human migration]].<ref>[[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]], 10.2.5.1.

Source: [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|NASA]].]] Regional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. The [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], small islands, [[Asia]]n [[river delta|megadeltas]] and [[Climate change in the Middle East and North Africa|the Middle East]] are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change.<ref name=""ar4 especially affected regions"">{{citation|author=IPCC|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains3-3-3.html Sec. 3.3.3 Especially affected systems, sectors and regions]|chapter=Synthesis report|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/main.html}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}. </ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Waha |first1=Katharina |title=Climate change impacts in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region and their implications for vulnerable population groups |journal=Regional Environmental Change |date=April 2017 |doi=10.1007/s10113-017-1144-2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316057764_Climate_change_impacts_in_the_Middle_East_and_Northern_Africa_MENA_region_and_their_implications_for_vulnerable_population_groups |accessdate=25 May 2020}}</ref> [[Tropics|Low-latitude]], [[developing country|less-developed]] regions are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change.<ref name=""schneider distribution of impacts"">{{citation|author=Schneider, S.H.|first=|title=In {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007|p=796}}|volume=|pages=|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-7.html Distribution of Impacts, in: Sec 19.3.7 Update on 'Reasons for Concern']|chapter=Ch 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|display-authors=etal}} </ref> [[Developed countries]] are also vulnerable to climate change.<ref name=""schneider regional vulnerabilities"">{{citation|author=Schneider, S.H.|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-3.html Sec 19.3.3 Regional vulnerabilities]|chapter=Ch 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007|p=792}} </ref> For example, developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some [[extreme weather]] events, such as [[heat wave]]s.<ref name=""schneider regional vulnerabilities"" /> Projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale.<ref name=""nrc 2008 climate change brochure"">{{cite book|url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/booklets/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.

In areas with [[Tilling (agriculture)|tilling]] it is 100 times higher. Climate Change increases land degradation and desertification. * In the years 1960 - 2013 the area of drylands in drought, increased by 1% per year. * In the year 2015 around 500 million people lived in areas that was impacted by [[desertification]] in the years 1980s - 2000s. * People who live in the areas affected by land degradation and desertification are ""increasingly negatively affected by climate change"". {{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL|2019|pp=7, 8}} {{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|2019|p=7,8}} Climate change will also cause soils to warm.

Source: [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|NASA]].]] Regional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]].
