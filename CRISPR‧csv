'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) (an acronym for '''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found in the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].<ref name=""pmid25574773"" /> These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of [[bacteriophage]]s that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of [[acquired immunity]].<ref name=""pmid25574773"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | author-link=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = The roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 32 | pages = 36–41 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25574773 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2014.12.008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Redman M, King A, Watson C, King D | title = What is CRISPR/Cas9? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition | volume = 101 | issue = 4 | pages = 213–215 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27059283 | pmc = 4975809 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2016-310459 }}</ref><ref name=""pmid17379808"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, Richards M, Boyaval P, Moineau S, Romero DA, Horvath P | s2cid=3888761 | author-link1=Rodolphe Barrangou | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5819 | pages = 1709–1712 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17379808 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138140 | bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1709B | hdl=20.500.11794/38902 | hdl-access = free }} {{Registration required}}</ref><ref name=""pmid19095942"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = CRISPR interference limits horizontal gene transfer in staphylococci by targeting DNA | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5909 | pages = 1843–1845 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19095942 | pmc = 2695655 | doi = 10.1126/science.1165771 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1843M }}</ref>  CRISPR are found in approximately 50% of sequenced [[bacterial genome]]s and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.<ref name=""Hille2018"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hille F, Richter H, Wong SP, Bratovič M, Ressel S, Charpentier E |title=The Biology of CRISPR-Cas: Backward and Forward |journal=Cell |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=1239–1259 |date=March 2018 |pmid=29522745 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.032 |hdl=21.11116/0000-0003-FC0D-4 |s2cid=3777503 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats took place independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the ""''iap"" gene'' ''(isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase)'' from the genome of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawat A, Roy M, Jyoti A, Kaushik S, Verma K, Srivastava VK | title = Cysteine proteases: Battling pathogenic parasitic protozoans with omnipresent enzymes | journal = Microbiological Research | volume = 249 | pages = 126784 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 33989978 | doi = 10.1016/j.micres.2021.126784 | s2cid = 234597200 }}</ref><ref name="":1"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–5433 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 | doi = 10.1128/jb.169.12.5429-5433.1987 }}</ref> that was their target. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersed different sequences.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name=""Hsu2014"" /> They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted [[direct repeat]]s (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened the direct repeats among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''<ref name=""Soolingen1993"">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–1995 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.31.8.1987-1995.1993 }}</ref> and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''[[wikt:spoligotyping|spoligotyping]]'', which is still in use today.<ref name=""Groenen1993"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–1065 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x | s2cid = 25304723 }}</ref><ref name=""Mojica2016"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–820 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}</ref>

[[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain studied repeats observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function. Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''.

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1–4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] [[Structural motif|motifs]], suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.<ref name=""pmid11952905"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–1575 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x | s2cid = 23196085 }}</ref> In this publication the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern.

The first publication<ref name=""pmid15791728"" /> proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica and collaborators at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells.

The Cas9 [[endonuclease]] is a four-component system that includes two small molecules: crRNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).<ref name=""Deltcheva2011"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deltcheva E, Chylinski K, Sharma CM, Gonzales K, Chao Y, Pirzada ZA, Eckert MR, Vogel J, Charpentier E | title = CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7340 | pages = 602–607 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21455174 | pmc = 3070239 | doi = 10.1038/nature09886 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..602D }}</ref><ref name=""Barrangou2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | author-link=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}</ref> [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a ""single-guide RNA"" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human [[tripronuclear zygotes]] first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant [[HBB|Beta-Hemoglobin]] (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein & Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 | pmid=25894090 | pmc=4417674}}</ref>

Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM]] (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cas12a's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5′ overhangs left by Cas12a can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.<ref name=""PMC5316869"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}</ref> Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18–23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in [[indel]] mutations that destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.<ref>{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|access-date = 2017-12-14}}</ref> A distinctive feature of Cas12a, as compared to Cas9, is that after cutting its target, Cas12a remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssDNA molecules non-discriminately.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JS, Ma E, Harrington LB, Da Costa M, Tian X, Palefsky JM, Doudna JA | title = CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6387 | pages = 436–439 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29449511 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar6245 | pmc = 6628903 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..436C | doi-access = free }}</ref> This property is called ""collateral cleavage"" or ""trans-cleavage"" activity and has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.<ref name=""CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SAR"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Broughton JP, Deng X, Yu G, Fasching CL, Servellita V, Singh J, Miao X, Streithorst JA, Granados A, Sotomayor-Gonzalez A, Zorn K, Gopez A, Hsu E, Gu W, Miller S, Pan CY, Guevara H, Wadford DA, Chen JS, Chiu CY | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–874 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32300245 | doi = 10.1038/s41587-020-0513-4 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=""Enhancement of trans-cleavage activ"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen LT, Smith BM, Jain PK | title = Enhancement of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a with engineered crRNA enables amplified nucleic acid detection | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 4906 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32999292 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-020-18615-1 | pmc = 7528031 | bibcode = 2020NatCo..11.4906N | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In 2016, the nuclease {{visible anchor|Cas13a}} (formerly known as {{visible anchor|C2c2}}) from the bacterium ''Leptotrichia shahii'' was characterized. Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, which means that it does not cleave DNA, but only single-stranded RNA. Cas13 is guided by its crRNA to a ssRNA target and binds and cleaves the target.

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===
Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.<!-- Okay, the numbers are from Makarova2015, and the Makarova2018 source has expanded them a bit. Its fig1 mentions 13 core gene families (instead of 11), but there's no mention of total gene families nor total gene count. --><ref name=""Makarova2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Makarova KS | title = Origins and evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[bacteriophage]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture phage DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.<ref name=""pmid22834906"" />

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.<ref name=""pmid22558257"" /><ref name=""pmid22771574"" /><ref name=""pmid22781758"" /> This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.<ref name=""pmid22781758"" />

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.<ref name=""pmid20125085"" /> This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs.

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits [[Cas3]] for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.<ref name=""pmid22949671"" /> [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.<ref name=""pmid22227115"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–313 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}</ref><ref name=""pmid19945378"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–956 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}</ref> The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,<ref name=""pmid23320564"" /><ref name=""pmid19945378"" /> which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.<ref name=""pmid22337052"" /> Type III systems were also found to target DNA in addition to RNA using a different Cas protein in the complex, Cas10.<ref name=""Estrella 2016"">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Estrella MA, Kuo FT, Bailey S| doi = 10.1101/gad.273722.115| title =RNA-activated DNA cleavage by the Type III-B CRISPR–Cas effector complex| journal = [[Genes & Development]] | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–470 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26848046| pmc = 4762430 }}</ref> The DNA cleavage was shown to be transcription dependent.<ref name=""Samai 2015"">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Samai P, Pyenson N, Jiang W, Goldberg GW, Hatoum-Aslan A, Marraffini LA| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.027| title =Co-transcriptional DNA and RNA Cleavage during Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity| journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1164–1174 | year = 2015 | pmid =25959775| pmc = 4594840 }}</ref>

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.<ref name=""pmid20072129"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–571 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}</ref> RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To resist a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.<ref name=""pmid20072129"" /> Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.<ref name=""pmid18065545"" /><ref name=""pmid20072129"" />

A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.<ref name=""pmid18065539"" /> Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''[[Salmonella enterica|S. enterica]]'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.<ref name=""pmid20559554"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | veditors = Randau L | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and phage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–16305|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|bibcode=2012PNAS..10916300R|doi-access=free}}</ref> The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.<ref name=""pmid23446421"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–491 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}</ref><ref name=""Boyd"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd CM, Angermeyer A, Hays SG, Barth ZK, Patel KM, Seed KD | title = Bacteriophage ICP1: A Persistent Predator of ''Vibrio cholerae'' | journal = Annual Review of Virology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 285–304 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34314595 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-virology-091919-072020 |issn=2327-056X | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Certain archaeal viruses were shown to carry mini-CRISPR arrays containing one or two spacers. It has been shown that spacers within the virus-borne CRISPR arrays target other viruses and plasmids, suggesting that mini-CRISPR arrays represent a mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and participate in interviral conflicts.<ref name=""pmid31729390"" />

=== CRISPR as diagnostic tool ===
CRISPR associated nucleases have shown to be useful as a tool for molecular testing due to their ability to specifically target nucleic acid sequences in a high background of non-target sequences. In 2016, the Cas9 nuclease was used to deplete unwanted nucleotide sequences in next-generation sequencing libraries while requiring only 250 picograms of initial RNA input.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5  }}</ref>  Beginning in 2017, CRISPR associated nucleases were also used for direct diagnostic testing of nucleic acids, down to single molecule sensitivity.<ref name=""Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR""/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JS, Ma E, Harrington LB, Da Costa M, Tian X, Palefsky JM, Doudna JA | title = CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6387 | pages = 436–439 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29449511 | pmc = 6628903 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar6245 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..436C }}</ref> CRISPR diversity is used as an analysis target to discern [[phylogeny]] and diversity in bacteria, such as in [[xanthomonad]]s by Martins ''et al.'', 2019.<ref name=""Elsalam-Lim-2021"">{{cite book | editor-last1=Abd-Elsalam | editor-first1=Kamel A. | editor-last2=Lim | editor-first2=Ki-Taek | title=CRISPR and RNAi Systems: Nanobiotechnology Approaches to Plant Breeding and Protection | publication-place=[[Amsterdam]] | date=2021 | isbn=978-0-12-821911-9 | oclc=1240283203 | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | pages=xxxvi+804}}</ref>{{rp|page=552}} Early detection of [[plant pathogenic bacteria|plant pathogens]] by molecular typing of the pathogen's CRISPRs can be used in agriculture as demonstrated by Shen ''et al.'', 2020.<ref name=""Elsalam-Lim-2021"" />{{rp|page=553}}

By coupling CRISPR-based diagnostics to additional enzymatic processes, the detection of molecules beyond nucleic acids is possible. One example of a coupled technology is SHERLOCK-based Profiling of IN vitro Transcription (SPRINT).

'''CRISPR gene editing ''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|i|s|p|ə|r}} ""crisper"") is a [[genetic engineering]] technique in [[molecular biology]] by which the [[genome]]s of living organisms may be modified. It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial [[CRISPR]]-[[Cas9]] antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 [[nuclease]] complexed with a synthetic [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name="":0"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bak RO, Gomez-Ospina N, [[Matthew Porteus|Porteus MH]] | title = Gene Editing on Center Stage | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 600–611 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29908711 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.004 | s2cid = 49269023 }}</ref>

The technique is considered highly significant in biotechnology and medicine as it allows for the genomes to be edited ''in vivo'' with extremely high precision, cheaply, and with ease. It can be used in the creation of new medicines, agricultural products, and [[genetically modified organisms]], or as a means of controlling pathogens and pests. It also has possibilities in the treatment of inherited [[genetic diseases]] as well as diseases arising from [[somatic mutation]]s such as cancer. However, its use in [[human germline engineering|human germline genetic modification]] is highly controversial.

Working like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of [[DNA]] to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via [[homology directed repair]] (HDR), is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.<ref name="":0"" /> This allows for the introduction of targeted [[DNA repair|DNA damage and repair]]. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.<ref name="":0"" /> This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for the repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9 result in the repair of the double-stranded break by means of [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ). NHEJ can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site, which may disrupt or alter gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR-Cas9 gives researchers the ability to generate targeted random gene disruption. Because of this, the precision of genome editing is a great concern. Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the genome.

While [[genome editing]] in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed had proved to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a large scale. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing is now a reality. Cas9 derived from the bacterial species ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' has facilitated targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells by allowing for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRNA guide strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Pandey M, Kahler JF, Loshakov A, Harris B, Dagur PK, Mo YY, Simonds WF | display-authors = 6 | title = Improving the specificity and efficacy of CRISPR/CAS9 and gRNA through target specific DNA reporter | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 189 | pages = 1–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25193712 | pmc = 4252756 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.033 }}</ref> The ease with which researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to [[gene silencing|silence]] or cause [[point mutation]]s at specific [[locus (genetics)|loci]] has proved invaluable to the quick and efficient [[gene mapping|mapping]] of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes.

==History==
=== Other methods ===
In the early 2000s, German researchers began developing [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. ZFNs has a higher precision and the advantage of being smaller than Cas9, but ZFNs are not as commonly used as CRISPR-based methods. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the design and creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a much more difficult and time-consuming process than that of designing guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires synthesizing only a short RNA sequence, a procedure that is already widely used for many other molecular biology techniques (e.g. creating [[oligonucleotide]] [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]]).<ref name=""MIT"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young S | date=11 February 2014 |title= CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|access-date=2014-04-13 |journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}</ref>

CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, and tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) or [[homology directed repair]] (HDR).

[[CRISPR-Cas9]] often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.<ref name=""Ran_2013"" /> The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA is uniquely designed for each application, as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to specific sequences within the host cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is also uniquely designed for each application, as it must complement to some degree the DNA sequences on either side of the cut and also contain whatever sequence is desired for insertion into the host genome.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).<ref>{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases | vauthors = Ly J |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |access-date=26 December 2016}}</ref> This sgRNA can be included alongside the gene that codes for the Cas9 protein and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

=== Structure ===
CRISPR-Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.<ref name=""Ran_2013"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–2308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}</ref> A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | s2cid = 17960960 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However, this is ultimately not too limiting, as it is typically a very short and nonspecific sequence that occurs frequently at many places throughout the genome (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).<ref name=""Ran_2013"" />

Once these sequences have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells, the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single- or double-stranded break at the appropriate location in the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sander JD, Joung JK | title = CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–55 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24584096 | pmc = 4022601 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2842 }}</ref>

Properly spaced single-stranded breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error-prone than the [[non-homologous end joining]] that typically follows a double-stranded break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9-induced DNA break.<ref name=""Ran_2013"" /> The goal is for the cell's native HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

=== Controlled genome editing ===
Further improvements and variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system have focused on introducing more control into its use. Specifically, the research aimed at improving this system includes improving its specificity, its efficiency, and the granularity of its editing power. Techniques can further be divided and classified by the component of the system they modify. These include using a different variants or novel creations of the Cas protein, using an altogether different effector protein, modifying the sgRNA, or using an algorithmic approach to identify existing optimal solutions.

Specificity is an important aspect to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 system because the off-target effects it generates have serious consequences for the genome of the cell and invokes caution for its use. Minimizing off-target effects is thus maximizing the safety of the system. Novel variations of Cas9 proteins that increase specificity include effector proteins with comparable efficiency and specificity to the original SpCas9 that are able to target the previously untargetable sequences and a variant that has virtually no off-target mutations.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cui |first=Zifeng |last2=Tian |first2=Rui |last3=Huang |first3=Zhaoyue |last4=Jin |first4=Zhuang |last5=Li |first5=Lifang |last6=Liu |first6=Jiashuo |last7=Huang |first7=Zheying |last8=Xie |first8=Hongxian |last9=Liu |first9=Dan |last10=Mo |first10=Haiyan |last11=Zhou |first11=Rong |date=2022-03-17 |title=FrCas9 is a CRISPR/Cas9 system with high editing efficiency and fidelity |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29089-8 |journal=Nature Communications |language=en |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1425 |doi=10.1038/s41467-022-29089-8 |issn=2041-1723 |pmc=8931148 |pmid=35301321}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kleinstiver |first=Benjamin P. |last2=Pattanayak |first2=Vikram |last3=Prew |first3=Michelle S. |last4=Tsai |first4=Shengdar Q. |last5=Nguyen |first5=Nhu T. |last6=Zheng |first6=Zongli |last7=Joung |first7=J.

Once pooled library is prepared it is necessary to carry out a deep sequencing (NGS, next generation sequencing) of PCR-amplifed plasmid DNA in order to reveal abundance of sgRNAs. Cells of interest can be consequentially infected by the library and then selected according to the phenotype. There are 2 types of selection: negative and positive. By negative selection dead or slow growing cells are efficiently detected. It can identify survival-essential genes, which can be further serve as candidates for molecularly targeted drugs. On the other hand, positive selection gives a collection of growth-advantage acquired populations by random mutagenesis.<ref name="":4"" /> After selection genomic DNA is collected and sequenced by NGS. Depletion or enrichment of sgRNAs is detected and compared to the original sgRNA library, annotated with the target gene that sgRNA corresponds to. Statistical analysis then identify genes that are significantly likely to be relevant to the phenotype of interest.<ref name="":5"" />

Apart from knock-out there are also knock-down (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa) libraries, which using the ability of proteolytically deactivated Cas9-fusion proteins (dCas9) to bind target DNA, which means that gene of interest is not cut but is over-expressed or repressed. It made CRISPR/Cas9 system even more interesting in gene editing. Inactive dCas9 protein modulate gene expression by targeting dCas9-repressors or activators toward promoter or transcriptional start sites of target genes. For repressing genes Cas9 can be fused to KRAB effector domain that makes complex with gRNA, whereas CRISPRa utilizes dCas9 fused to different transcriptional activation domains, which are further directed by gRNA to promoter regions to upregulate expression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McDade JR, Waxmonsky NC, Swanson LE, Fan M | title = Practical Considerations for Using Pooled Lentiviral CRISPR Libraries | journal = Current Protocols in Molecular Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = 31.5.1–31.5.13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27366891 | doi = 10.1002/cpmb.8 | s2cid = 5055878 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng AW, Wang H, Yang H, Shi L, Katz Y, Theunissen TW, Rangarajan S, Shivalila CS, Dadon DB, Jaenisch R | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiplexed activation of endogenous genes by CRISPR-on, an RNA-guided transcriptional activator system | journal = Cell Research | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1163–71 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23979020 | pmc = 3790238 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2013.122 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Horlbeck MA, Adamson B, Villalta JE, Chen Y, Whitehead EH, Guimaraes C, Panning B, Ploegh HL, Bassik MC, Qi LS, Kampmann M, Weissman JS | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–61 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307932 | pmc = 4253859 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029 }}</ref>

=== Disease models ===
Cas9 genomic modification has allowed for the quick and efficient generation of [[transgene|transgenic]] models within the field of genetics. Cas9 can be easily introduced into the target cells along with sgRNA via plasmid transfection in order to model the spread of diseases and the cell's response to and defense against infection.<ref name="":12"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dow LE | title = Modeling Disease In Vivo With CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 609–621 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432018 | pmc = 4592741 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.07.006 }}</ref> The ability of Cas9 to be introduced ''in vivo'' allows for the creation of more accurate models of gene function and mutation effects, all while avoiding the off-target mutations typically observed with older methods of genetic engineering.

The CRISPR and Cas9 revolution in genomic modeling does not extend only to mammals. Traditional genomic models such as ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', one of the first model organisms, have seen further refinement in their resolution with the use of Cas9.<ref name="":12"" /> Cas9 uses cell-specific promoters allowing a controlled use of the Cas9. Cas9 is an accurate method of treating diseases due to the targeting of the Cas9 enzyme only affecting certain cell types. The cells undergoing the Cas9 therapy can also be removed and reintroduced to provide amplified effects of the therapy.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite book | vauthors = Doudna J, Mali P | title = CRISPR-Cas: A Laboratory Manual |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-62182-130-4 |location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|oclc=922914104}}</ref>

CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and to eliminate individual genes or even entire [[chromosome]]s from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been successfully deleted ''in vivo'' using CRISPR techniques include the Y chromosome and X chromosome of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic disorders caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.<ref name=""pmid29178945"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4}}

Concerns have been raised that [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may confound the results of a CRISPR gene editing experiment (i.e. the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).

'''CRISPR and Blindness'''

The CRISPR treatment for LCA10 (the most common variant of Leber Congenital Amaurosis which is the leading cause of inherited childhood blindness) modifies the patient's defective photoreceptor gene.

In March 2020, the first patient volunteer in this US-based study, sponsored by Editas Medicine, was given a low-dose of the treatment to test for safety.

In June 2021, enrollment began for a high-dose adult  and pediatric cohort of 4 patient volunteers each. Dosing of the new cohorts is expected to be completed by July 2022.<ref name="":9"" />

==== CRISPR and Diabetes ====
Type 1 Diabetes is an endocrine disorder which results from a lack of pancreatic beta cells to produce insulin, a vital compound in transporting blood sugar to cells for producing energy. Researchers have been trying to transplant healthy beta cells. CRISPR is used to edit the cells in order to reduce the chance the patient's body will reject the transplant.

In February 2022, a phase 1 trial was conducted in which one patient volunteer received treatment.<ref name="":9"" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=CRISPR Therapeutics and ViaCyte, Inc.

==== CRISPR and HIV/AIDS ====
Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. While effective treatments exist which can allow patients to live healthy lives, HIV is retroactive meaning that it embeds an inactive version of itself in the human genome. CRISPR can be used to selectively remove the virus from the genome by designing guide RNA to target the retroactive HIV genome. One issue with this approach is that it requires the removal of the HIV genome from almost all cells, which can be difficult to realistically achieve.<ref name="":9"" />

{{main|CRISPR interference}}
[[File:Dead-Cas9 potential applications.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A dead Cas9 protein coupled with epigenetic modifiers which are used to repress certain genome sequences rather than cutting it all together.<ref name=""auto""/>]]
Using ""dead"" versions of Cas9 ([[Cas9#Interference of transcription by dCas9|dCas9]]) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity.<ref name=""Science_Breakthrough"">{{cite web | title = And Science's Breakthrough of the Year is ...|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/12/and-science-s-breakthrough-year|website = news.sciencemag.org|access-date = 2015-12-21|date = December 17, 2015|last = Science News Staff}}</ref> Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated, [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA. Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.<ref name=""auto""/> Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews.

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.<ref name=""craze2"" />

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled CRISPR genes. They considered the fusobacterium ''[[Leptotrichia shahii]]''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.<ref name=""Zimmer_2016"">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of CRISPR Gene Editing With New Capabilities| vauthors = Zimmer C | date=2016-06-03 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}</ref> C2c2 has later been renamed to Cas13a to fit the standard nomenclature for Cas genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickar-Oliver A, Gersbach CA | title = The next generation of CRISPR-Cas technologies and applications | journal = Nature Reviews.

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with Cas13 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.<ref name=""Zimmer_2016"" />

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of the US, UK, and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cell]]s, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, and germline cells, where genome changes can be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene–environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate heritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.<ref name=""National Academy of Science"">{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | access-date = 3 December 2015 }}</ref>

In February 2017, the [[United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] ([[NASEM]]) Committee on Human Gene Editing published a report reviewing ethical, legal, and scientific concerns of genomic engineering technology. The conclusion of the report stated that heritable [[genome editing]] is impermissible now but could be justified for certain medical conditions; however, they did not justify the usage of [[CRISPR]] for enhancement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brokowski C | title = Do CRISPR Germline Ethics Statements Cut It? | journal = The CRISPR Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–125 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 31021208 | pmc = 6694771 | doi = 10.1089/crispr.2017.0024 }}</ref>

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui|Jiankui He]] announced that he had edited two human embryos to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, [[Lulu and Nana controversy|Lulu and Nana]], had been born a few weeks earlier. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Begley S |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}</ref> An international group of scientists called for a global moratorium on genetically editing human embryos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/13/scientists-call-for-global-moratorium-on-crispr-gene-editing|title=Scientists call for global moratorium on gene editing of embryos| vauthors = Sample I |date=13 March 2019|access-date=14 March 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===
Policy regulations for the CRISPR-Cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryo]]s by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}</ref>

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment, and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined ""plant pest"" or any plant not previously categorized.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x | s2cid = 3210837 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the [[white button mushroom]] to make them non-browning.

In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next five years and any new regulations that might be needed as a result.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–9 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}</ref> In 2017, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] proposed a rule that would classify genetic engineering modifications to animals as ""animal drugs"", subjecting them to strict regulation if offered for sale and reducing the ability for individuals and small businesses to make them profitable.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ | title = The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers | vauthors = Brown KV | work = Gizmodo | date = 1 February 2017 | access-date = 5 February 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM113903.pdf |title=Guidance for Industry #187 / Regulation of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals |website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=2020-02-11 }}</ref>

'''Anti-CRISPR''' (Anti-Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats or Acr) is a group of proteins found in [[Bacteriophage|phages]], that inhibit the normal activity of [[CRISPR]]-Cas, the immune system of certain [[bacteria]].<ref name = ""Nakamura_2019"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura M, Srinivasan P, Chavez M, Carter MA, Dominguez AA, La Russa M, Lau MB, Abbott TR, Xu X, Zhao D, Gao Y, Kipniss NH, Smolke CD, Bondy-Denomy J, Qi LS | display-authors = 6 | title = Anti-CRISPR-mediated control of gene editing and synthetic circuits in eukaryotic cells | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 194 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30643127 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-08158-x | pmc = 6331597 | bibcode = 2019NatCo..10..194N }}</ref> CRISPR consists of [[Genome|genomic]] sequences that can be found in [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic organisms]], that come from [[bacteriophage]]s that infected the bacteria beforehand, and are used to defend the cell from further viral attacks.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = The roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 32 | pages = 36–41 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25574773 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2014.12.008 }}</ref> Anti-CRISPR results from an evolutionary process occurred in phages in order to avoid having their [[genome]]s destroyed by the [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells that they will infect.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanley SY, Borges AL, Chen KH, Swaney DL, Krogan NJ, Bondy-Denomy J, Davidson AR | title = Anti-CRISPR-Associated Proteins Are Crucial Repressors of Anti-CRISPR Transcription | journal = Cell | volume = 178 | issue = 6 | pages = 1452–1464.e13 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31474367 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.046 | pmc = 6754177 }}</ref>

Before the discovery of this type of family proteins, the acquisition of mutations was the only way known that phages could use to avoid [[CRISPR|CRISPR-Cas]] mediated shattering, by reducing the binding affinity of the phage and CRISPR. Nonetheless, bacteria have mechanisms to retarget the mutant bacteriophage, a process that it is called ""priming adaptation"". So, as far as researchers currently know, anti-CRISPR is the most effective way to ensure the survival of phages throughout the infection process of bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxwell KL | title = The Anti-CRISPR Story: A Battle for Survival | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–14 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28985512 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.002 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== History ==
Anti-CRISPR systems were first seen in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' prophages,<ref name=""Bondy-Denomy_2013"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bondy-Denomy J, Pawluk A, Maxwell KL, Davidson AR | title = Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = 7432 | pages = 429–32 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23242138 | doi = 10.1038/nature11723 | pmc = 4931913 | bibcode = 2013Natur.493..429B }}</ref> which disabled type I-F CRISPR–Cas system, characteristic of some strains of these bacteria. After analysing the genomic sequences of these phages, genes codifying five different Anti-CRISPR proteins (also named Acrs) were discovered. Such proteins were '''AcrF1''', '''AcrF2''', '''AcrF3''', '''AcrF4''' and '''AcrF5'''. Research found none of these proteins disrupted the expression of Cas genes nor the assembling of CRISPR molecules, so it was thought that those type I-F [[protein]]s directly affected the CRISPR–Cas interference.<ref name=""Pawluk_2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawluk A, Davidson AR, Maxwell KL | title = Anti-CRISPR: discovery, mechanism and function | journal = Nature Reviews. Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–17 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29062071 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro.2017.120 | s2cid = 13222384 }}</ref>

Further investigation confirmed this hypothesis with the discovery of 4 other proteins ('''AcrE1''', '''AcrE2''', '''AcrE3''' and '''AcrE4'''), which were shown to impede ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''’s CRISPR-Cas system.<ref name = ""Pawluk_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawluk A, Bondy-Denomy J, Cheung VH, Maxwell KL, Davidson AR | title = A new group of phage anti-CRISPR genes inhibits the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00896 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24736222 | pmc = 3993853 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00896-14 }}</ref>  Furthermore, the locus of the genes codifying these type I-E proteins was really close to the one responsible for the type I-F proteins expression in the same group of phages, leading to the conclusion that both types of proteins worked together.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges AL, Davidson AR, Bondy-Denomy J | title = The Discovery, Mechanisms, and Evolutionary Impact of Anti-CRISPRs | journal = Annual Review of Virology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–59 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28749735 | pmc = 6039114 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-virology-101416-041616 }}</ref> However, these first nine proteins shared no common [[sequence motif]]s, which would have made easier the identification of new Anti-CRISPR protein families.

Later on, it was seen that phages that produced such proteins also encoded a putative [[transcriptional regulator]] named '''Aca 1''' (anti-CRISPR associated 1) which was genetically located really close to the anti-CRISPR genes. This regulatory protein is supposed to be the responsible for the anti-CRISPR gene expression during the infectious cycle of the phage,  therefore, both types of proteins (anti-CRISPR and Aca1) seem to work together as a single mechanism.<ref name=""Bondy-Denomy_2013""/>

After some studies, a similar [[Amino acid sequence|amino-acid sequence]] to that of Aca1 was found, leading to the discovery of '''Aca2''', a new family of Aca proteins. Aca2 also revealed the existence of five new groups of type I-F anti-CRISPR proteins due to their genomic proximity: '''AcrF6''', '''AcrF7''', '''AcrF8''', '''AcrF9''' and '''AcrF10'''. These proteins were not only present in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''’s phages, as they also affected other cells of the ''[[Pseudomonadota]]'' (formerly ''Proteobacteria'').<ref name=""Pawluk_2018"" />

Thanks to the use of bioinformatic tools, in 2016, '''AcrIIC1''', '''AcrIIC2''' and '''AcrIIC3''' protein families were discovered in ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' (which had been infected by phages previously). Such proteins were the first inhibitors of type II CRISPR–Cas to be found (concretely, they impeded II-C CRISPR–Cas9, the type of mechanism used in the genetic edition of human cells).<ref name=""Pawluk 1829–1838.e9"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawluk A, Amrani N, Zhang Y, Garcia B, Hidalgo-Reyes Y, Lee J, Edraki A, Shah M, Sontheimer EJ, Maxwell KL, Davidson AR | display-authors = 6 | title = Naturally Occurring Off-Switches for CRISPR-Cas9 | journal = Cell | volume = 167 | issue = 7 | pages = 1829–1838.e9 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27984730 | pmc = 5757841 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.017 }}</ref> A year later, a study confirmed the presence of type II-A CRISPR–Cas9 inhibitors ('''AcrIIA1''', '''AcrIIA2''', '''AcrIIA3''' and '''AcrIIA4''') in ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' (infected by bacteriophages which introduced the anti-CRISPR proteins). Two of those proteins (AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4) were demonstrated to work properly against ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' type II-A defensive CRISPR system.

The result of all this research has been the discovery of 21 different Anti-CRISPR protein families, despite other inhibitors may exist due to the quick [[mutation]]al process of phages. Thus, more research is needed to unravel the complexity of anti-CRISPR systems.

== Types ==
Anti-CRISPR genes can be found in different parts of the phage DNA: in the capsid, the tail and at the extreme end. Moreover, it has been found that many MGEs have two or even three Acr genes in a single [[operon]], which suggest that they could have been exchanged between MGEs.<ref name=""Pawluk_2016"" />

As all proteins, Acr family proteins are formed by the translation and transduction of the genes, and their classification is based on the type of CRISPR-Cas system they inhibit, due to the fact that each anti-CRISPR protein inhibits a specific CRISPR-Cas system. Although not many anti-CRISPR proteins have been discovered, these are the ones that have been found so far:

So far, genes encoding anti-CRISPR proteins have been found in [[Mycovirus|myophages]], [[Siphoviridae|siphophages]], [[putative conjugative elements]] and [[Pathogenicity island|pathogenicity islands]]. 

Attempts have been made to find common surrounding genetic features of anti-CRISPR genes, but without any success. Nevertheless, the presence of an ''aca'' gene just below anti-CRISPR genes has been observed.<ref name=""Pawluk_2016"" />

The first Acr protein families to be discovered were AcrF1, AcrF2, AcrF3, AcrF4 and AcrF5.<ref name=""Bondy-Denomy_2013"" /> These inhibitors are mainly found in ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' phages, which are capable of infecting ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa|Pseudomonas aeruginosas]]'' possessing a type I‑F CRISPR–Cas system. Then, in another study, AcrE1, AcrE2, AcrE3 and AcrE4 protein families were found to also inhibit the type I‑F CRISPR–Cas in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosas.''<ref name=""Pawluk_2014"" />

Later on, AcrF6, AcrF7, AcrF8, AcrF9 and AcrF10 protein families, which were also able to inhibit type I‑F CRISPR–Cas, were found to be very common in [[Pseudomonadota]] [[Mobile genetic elements|MGEs]].<ref name=""Pawluk_2016"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawluk A, Staals RH, Taylor C, Watson BN, Saha S, Fineran PC, Maxwell KL, Davidson AR | display-authors = 6 | title = Inactivation of CRISPR-Cas systems by anti-CRISPR proteins in diverse bacterial species | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | pages = 16085 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27573108 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.85 | s2cid = 3826582 }}</ref>

The first inhibitors of a type II CRISPR–Cas system were then discovered: AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2 and AcrIIC3, that block the type II‑C CRISPR–Cas9 activity of ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]].''<ref name=""Pawluk 1829–1838.e9"" />

Finally, AcrIIA1, AcrIIA2, AcrIIA3 and AcrIIA4 were found. These protein families have the ability to inhibit the type II‑A CRISPR–Cas system of ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]].''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rauch BJ, Silvis MR, Hultquist JF, Waters CS, McGregor MJ, Krogan NJ, Bondy-Denomy J | title = Inhibition of CRISPR-Cas9 with Bacteriophage Proteins | journal = Cell | volume = 168 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 150–158.e10 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28041849 | pmc = 5235966 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2016.12.009 }}</ref>

As for the naming convention of Acr family proteins, it is established as follows: firstly, the type of system inhibited, then a numerical value referring to the protein family and finally the source of the specific anti-CRISPR protein. For example, AcrF9''<sub>Vpa</sub>'' is active against the type I-F CRISPR–Cas system. It also was the ninth anti-CRISPR described for this system, and it is encoded in an integrated MGE in a ''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]'' genome.

== Structure ==
As exposed above, there is a wide spectrum of anti-CRISPR proteins, but few of these have been deeply studied. One of the most studied and well-defined Acrs is AcrIIA4, which inhibits Cas9, thus blocking the II-A CRISPR-Cas system of ''Streptococcus pyogenes''.

=== AcrIIA4 ===
[[File:AcrIIA4.jpg|thumb|[[File:AcrIIA4 20 secuencias.jpg|frameless]]

Structure of AcrIIA4 obtained with the UCSF Chimera software,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/|title=UCSF Chimera |website=Chimera|access-date=25 October 2019 }}</ref> where its PDB file was uploaded.<ref name=""PDB_5XN4"" /> Different colours were assigned to the four different secondary structures found in this protein: blue for β-strands, red for α-helices, orange for the 3<sub>10</sub> helix, and grey for loops. Originally, the PDB file contains the 20 lowest energy sequences (and thus, the most stable ones) superposed, one of which was randomly selected to create the figure. <ref name=""Kim_2018"" />]]
The protein was solved using [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR); it contains 87 residues and its molecular weight is 10.182 kDa.<ref name=""PDB_5XN4"">{{cite journal |url= http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5XN4 |title=AcrIIA4 - PDB |website=Protein Data Bank|access-date=2019-10-15|doi=10.2210/pdb5xn4/pdb }}</ref> AcrIIA4 contains:

* '''3 antiparallel [[Beta sheet|β-strands]]''' (the first, from residues 16 to 19, the second, from 29 to 33, and the third, from 40 to 44) that form a β-sheet. This represents a 16,1% of the total number of amino acids, as 14 of them form the β-strands.
* '''3 [[Alpha helix|α-helices]]''' (the first, 2–13 residues, the second, 50–59 residues, and the third, 68–85 residues).
* '''1 [[310 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]]''' placed between the first (β1) and second (β2) β-strands, which starts at residue 22 and end in residue 25. The total helical part is composed of 40 residues, which is a 50,6% of the protein.
* '''Loops''' joining the different secondary structures.

There is a good definition of the secondary structures, as the three α-helices are packed near the three β-strands. Strikingly, between β3 strand, α2 and α3 helices, there is a hydrophobic core, originated by a cluster of aromatic side chains which are attracted by non-covalent interactions, such as [[Stacking (chemistry)|pi stacking]]. Moreover, as it is an acidic protein, there is a high concentration of negatively charged residues in the loops between β3 and α2, between α2 and α3, and in the first part of α3, which may play an important role in the inhibition of Cas9, as negative charges might imitate [[phosphate]]s of nucleic acids.<ref name=""Kim_2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim I, Jeong M, Ka D, Han M, Kim NK, Bae E, Suh JY | title = Solution structure and dynamics of anti-CRISPR AcrIIA4, the Cas9 inhibitor | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3883 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29497118 | pmc = 5832863 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-22177-0 | bibcode = 2018NatSR...8.3883K }}</ref>

=== AcrF1 ===
On the other hand, there is another Acr, AcrF1, which may not have been as studied as the explained above, although there is a good description of its structure. It inhibits the I-F CRISPR-Cas system of ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. Maxwell et al.<ref name=""Maxwell_2016"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxwell KL, Garcia B, Bondy-Denomy J, Bona D, Hidalgo-Reyes Y, Davidson AR | title = The solution structure of an anti-CRISPR protein | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13134 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27725669 | pmc = 5062604 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13134 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713134M }}</ref> solved the 3D structure using NMR.

The protein contains 78 residues,<ref name=""Pawluk_2018"" /> between which interact to form secondary structures. The structure of AcrF1 is formed of two anti-parallel α-helices and a β-sheet, which contains four anti-parallel β-strands. This β-sheet is placed in the contrary side of the α-helical part, which creates a hydrophobic core formed of 13 amino acids. Turns can also be found in different parts of the protein, for instance, joining the β-strands.<ref name=""Maxwell_2016"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2LW5|title=AcrF1 - PDB|journal=To be Published|access-date=2019-10-14|doi=10.2210/pdb2lw5/pdb| vauthors = Davidson AR, Pawluk A, Maxwell KL, Bondy-Denomy J }}</ref>

There are surface residues which actively participate in the active site of AcrF1, two of which are [[tyrosine]]s (Y6 and Y20) and the third amino acid is a [[glutamic acid]] (E31), as their mutation by an [[alanine]] causes a 100-fold decrease in the activity of the protein (with Y20A and E31A mutations), and a 10<sup>7</sup>-fold decrease when Y6 is mutated.

The different structures that form the protein create a strange combination, as Maxwell et al. conducted a DALI search in order to find similarities between other proteins, and they found no informative similarities.<ref name=""Maxwell_2016"" />

== Function ==
=== Avoiding destruction of the phage DNA ===
The principal function of anti-CRISPR proteins is to interact with specific components of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as the effector [[nuclease]]s, to avoid the destruction of the phage DNA (by binding or cleavage). <ref name=""van_Gent_2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Gent M, Gack MU | title = Viral Anti-CRISPR Tactics: No Success without Sacrifice | language = en | journal = Immunity | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 391–393 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30231980 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2018.08.023 | doi-access = free }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Gomila J, Hanel M, Faraguna C |url= https://golden.com/wiki/Anti-CRISPR_Proteins |title=Anti-CRISPR Proteins |website=Golden|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>

A phage introduces its DNA into a prokaryotic cell, usually the cell detects a sequence known as ""target"", that activates CRISPR-Cas immune system, but the presence of an initial sequence (before the target) encoding the formation of Acr proteins, avoids phage destruction. Acr proteins are formed before the target sequence is read. This way, the CRISPR-Cas system is blocked before it can develop a response. 

The procedure starts with the CRISPR [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] being transcribed into crRNAs (CRISPR RNA). CrRNAs combine with Cas proteins forming a ribonucleoprotein complex called Cascade. This complex surveys the cell to find complementary sequences of the crRNA. When this sequence is found, the Cas3 nuclease is recruited to the Cascade, and the target DNA from the phage is cleaved. But, for instance, when AcrF1 and AcrF2 are found (anti-CRISPR proteins), these interact with Cas7f and Cas8f-Cas5f, respectively, not allowing the binding to the phage DNA. Moreover, the cleaving of the target is prevented by the union between AcrF3 and Cas3. <ref name=""Pawluk_2018"" />

[[File:Phage cooperation against CRISPR immunity.png|thumb|290x290px|'''Phage-phage cooperation:''' First phage infections may be unable to hamper the CRISPR immunity, but phage-phage cooperations increasingly boost Acr production and host immunosuppression, which produces an increase on the vulnerability of the host cell to reinfection, and finally allows a successful infection and spreading of a second phage.

The majority of Acr genes are located next to anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) genes, which encode proteins with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Aca genes are preserved, and researchers are using them to identify Acr genes, but the function of the proteins they encode is not totally clear. The Acr-associated promoter produces high levels of Acr transcription just after the phage DNA injection into the bacteria takes place and, afterward, Aca proteins repress the transcription. If this wasn't repressed, the constant transcription of the gene would be lethal to the phage. Therefore, Aca activity is essential to ensure its survival. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.ub.edu/CAS/index.php/login?service=https%3a%2f%2flogin.sire.ub.edu%2flogin%3fqurl%3dezp.2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2VsbC5jb20vY2VsbC9mdWxsdGV4dC9TMDA5Mi04Njc0KDE5KTMwODQ2LTM.X3JldHVyblVSTD1odHRwczovL2xpbmtpbmdodWIuZWxzZXZpZXIuY29tL3JldHJpZXZlL3BpaS9TMDA5Mjg2NzQxOTMwODQ2Mz9zaG93YWxsPXRydWU-|title=Inici sessió - Identificació UB - Universitat de Barcelona|website=sso.ub.edu|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>

=== Phage-phage cooperation ===
Moreover, it has been verified that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas systems are still partially immune to Acr. Consequently, initial abortive phage infections may be unable to hamper CRISPR immunity, but phage-phage cooperation can increasingly boost Acr production and promote immunosuppression, which might produce an increase on the vulnerability of the host cell to reinfection, and finally allow a successful infection and spreading of a second phage. <ref name=""van_Gent_2018"" /> This cooperation creates an epidemiological tipping point, in which, depending on the initial density of Acr-phages and the strength of CRISPR/Acr binding, phages can either be eliminated or originate a phage epidemic (the number of bacteriophages is amplified). <ref name=""Landsberger_2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landsberger M, Gandon S, Meaden S, Rollie C, Chevallereau A, Chabas H, Buckling A, Westra ER, van Houte S | display-authors = 6 | title = Anti-CRISPR Phages Cooperate to Overcome CRISPR-Cas Immunity | journal = Cell | volume = 174 | issue = 4 | pages = 908–916.e12 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30033365 | pmc = 6086933 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.058 }}</ref><ref name="":0"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges AL, Zhang JY, Rollins MF, Osuna BA, Wiedenheft B, Bondy-Denomy J | title = Bacteriophage Cooperation Suppresses CRISPR-Cas3 and Cas9 Immunity | journal = Cell | volume = 174 | issue = 4 | pages = 917–925.e10 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30033364 | pmc = 6086726 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.013 }}</ref>

If the starting levels of phages are high enough, the density of immunosuppressed hosts reaches a critical point where there are more successful infections than unsuccessful ones. Then, an epidemic begins. If this point is not reached, phage extinction occurs, and immunosuppressed hosts recover their initial state.  <ref name=""Landsberger_2018"" /><ref name="":0"" />

=== Phage immune evasion ===
It has become clear that Acr proteins play an important role in allowing phage immune evasion, though it is still unclear how anti-CRISPR proteins synthesis can overcome the host’s CRISPR-Cas system, which can shatter the phage genome within minutes after the infection.<ref name=""van_Gent_2018"" /> 

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system and inhibition mechanisms of three type I-F anti-CRISPRs..png|thumb|392x392px|Diagram showing type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, as well as inhibition mechanisms of three type I-F anti-CRISPRs. Type I-F CRISPR complex is made of 60 crRNA nucleotides and nine Cas proteins (the protein type is specified by the numbers 5,8,7,6). AcrF1 goes to Cas7f, preventing target DNA access to the crRNA guide. AcrF2 interacts both with Cas8f and Cas7f, difficulting target DNA access to the binding pocket. Finally, AcrF3 forms a [[Protein dimer|homodimer]], interacting with Cas3 by preventing its contact with the Cascade complex. ''Based on a representation from a review found in the references below.'' <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu Y, Zhang F, Huang Z | title = Structural insights into the inactivation of CRISPR-Cas systems by diverse anti-CRISPR proteins | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 32 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29554913 | pmc = 5859409 | doi = 10.1186/s12915-018-0504-9 }}</ref>|alt=]]
Within all the Anti-CRISPR proteins that have been discovered so far, mechanisms have been described for only 15 of among them. These mechanisms can be divided into three different types: crRNA loading interference, DNA binding blockage and DNA [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]] prevention.

=== CrRNA loading interference ===
CrRNA (CRISPR RNA) loading interference mechanism has been mainly associated with the AcrIIC2 protein family.<ref name=""Zhu_2019"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu Y, Gao A, Zhan Q, Wang Y, Feng H, Liu S, Gao G, Serganov A, Gao P | display-authors = 6 | title = Diverse Mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 Inhibition by Type IIC Anti-CRISPR Proteins | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 296–309.e7 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30850331 | pmc = 6750902 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2019.01.038 }}</ref> In order to block [[Cas9]] activity, it prevents the correct assembly of the crRNA‐Cas9 complex.

=== DNA binding blockage ===
AcrIIC2 has been shown not to be the only one capable of blocking DNA binding. There are 11 other Acr family proteins that can also carry it out. Some among those are AcrIF1, AcrIF2, and AcrIF10, which act on different subunits of the [[Biochemical cascade|Cascade effector]] complex of the type I‐F CRISPR‐Cas system, preventing the DNA to bind to the complex. <ref name=""Bondy-Denomy_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bondy-Denomy J, Garcia B, Strum S, Du M, Rollins MF, Hidalgo-Reyes Y, Wiedenheft B, Maxwell KL, Davidson AR | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiple mechanisms for CRISPR-Cas inhibition by anti-CRISPR proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 136–9 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26416740 | pmc = 4935067 | doi = 10.1038/nature15254 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526..136B }}</ref>

Furthermore, AcrIIC3 prevents DNA binding by promoting [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerization]] of Cas9 <ref name=""Zhu_2019"" /><ref name=""Harrington_2017"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington LB, Doxzen KW, Ma E, Liu JJ, Knott GJ, Edraki A, Garcia B, Amrani N, Chen JS, Cofsky JC, Kranzusch PJ, Sontheimer EJ, Davidson AR, Maxwell KL, Doudna JA | display-authors = 6 | title = A Broad-Spectrum Inhibitor of CRISPR-Cas9 | journal = Cell | volume = 170 | issue = 6 | pages = 1224–1233.e15 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28844692 | pmc = 5875921 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.037 }}</ref> and AcrIIA2 mimics DNA, thereby blocking the [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM]] recognition residues and consequently preventing dsDNA ''(double-stranded DNA)'' recognition and binding. <ref name = ""Shin_2017"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin J, Jiang F, Liu JJ, Bray NL, Rauch BJ, Baik SH, Nogales E, Bondy-Denomy J, Corn JE, Doudna JA | display-authors = 6 | title = Disabling Cas9 by an anti-CRISPR DNA mimic | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e1701620 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28706995 | pmc = 5507636 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701620 | bibcode = 2017SciA....3E1620S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo M, Wang S, Zhu Y, Wang S, Xiong Z, Yang J, Xu Z, Huang Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis of CRISPR-SpyCas9 inhibition by an anti-CRISPR protein | journal = Nature | volume = 546 | issue = 7658 | pages = 436–439 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28448066 | doi = 10.1038/nature22377 | bibcode = 2017Natur.546..436D | s2cid = 4445217 }}</ref>

=== DNA cleavage prevention ===
AcrE1, AcrIF3 and AcrIIC1 can prevent target DNA cleavage. Using [[X-ray crystallography]], AcrE1 was discovered to bind to the CRISPR associated Cas3. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawluk A, Shah M, Mejdani M, Calmettes C, Moraes TF, Davidson AR, Maxwell KL | title = Disabling a Type I-E CRISPR-Cas Nuclease with a Bacteriophage-Encoded Anti-CRISPR Protein | journal = mBio | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29233895 | pmc = 5727412 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01751-17 }}</ref> Likewise, biochemical and structural analysis of AcrIF3 showed its capacity of binding to Cas3 as a dimer so as to prevent the recruitment of Cas3 to the Cascade complex. <ref name=""Bondy-Denomy_2015"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Ma J, Cheng Z, Meng X, You L, Wang M, Zhang X, Wang Y | display-authors = 6 | title = A CRISPR evolutionary arms race: structural insights into viral anti-CRISPR/Cas responses | journal = Cell Research | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1165–1168 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27585537 | pmc = 5113301 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2016.103 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Yao D, Xu JG, Li AR, Xu J, Fu P, Zhou Y, Zhu Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis of Cas3 inhibition by the bacteriophage protein AcrF3 | journal = Nature Structural & Molecular Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 868–70 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27455460 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.3269 | s2cid = 6466590 }}</ref> Finally, thanks to biochemical and structural AcrIIC1 studies, it was found that it binds to the active site of the [[Homing endonuclease|HNH endonuclease]] domain in Cas9, which prevents DNA from cleaving. Thus, it turns Cas9 into an inactive but DNA bound state.<ref name=""Harrington_2017"" />

== Applications ==
[[File:Phage therapy.png|thumb|'''Phage therapy''' could be used against antibiotic resistance, as bacteriophages can kill bacteria, and cure an infection.]]

=== Reducing CRISPR-Cas9 off-target cuts ===
AcrIIA4 is one of the proteins responsible for the CRISPR-Cas9 system inhibition, the mechanism used in mammalian cells edition. Addition of AcrIIA4 in human cells avoids Cas9 interaction with the CRISPR system, reducing its ability to cut DNA. However, diverse studies have reached the conclusion that adding it in small proportions after the genome editing has been done, reduces the number of off-target cuts at the concrete sites in which Cas9 interacts, a thing that makes the whole system much more precise. <ref name = ""Shin_2017"" />
=== Avoiding ecological consequences ===
One of the main objectives of using CRISPR-Cas9 technology is eradicating diseases, some of which are found in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vectors]], such as mosquitoes. Anti-CRISPR proteins can impede [[gene drive]], which could create uncertain and catastrophic consequences in [[ecosystem]]s. <ref name=""Zhang_2019"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang F, Song G, Tian Y | title = Anti-CRISPRs: The natural inhibitors for CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = Animal Models and Experimental Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–75 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31392299 | pmc = 6600654 | doi = 10.1002/ame2.12069 }}</ref>

=== Detect presence of Cas9 in a sample ===
[[File:Anti-Crispr Phage Therapy.jpg|thumb|Phage therapy is a good alternative to the use of antibiotics, but some bacteria have CRISPR-Cas systems. Nevertheless, if phages had Acr proteins, they would inhibit the CRISPR-Cas immune system and infect the cell. At the end of the phage reproduction cycle, which takes place inside bacteria, new phages would be released, provoking the cell lysis.]]
In order to know whether a certain bacterium synthesises Cas9, and therefore uses CRISPR-Cas9, or to detect accidental or not allowed use of this system, AcrIIC1 can be used. As the aforementioned protein binds to Cas9, a centrifugal microfluidic platform has been designed to detect it and determine its catalytic activity.<ref name=""Zhang_2019"" />

=== Phage therapy ===
[[Antimicrobial resistance|Antibiotic resistance]] is a public health problem that is constantly increasing, because of the bad use of antibiotics. [[Phage therapy]] consists of the infection of bacteria using phages, which are much more specific and cause less side effects than antibiotics. Acrs could inhibit the CRISPR-Cas9 system of some bacteria and allow these phages to infect bacterial cells without being attacked by its immune system. <ref name=""Zhang_2019"" />

'''CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)''' is a type of [[CRISPR]] tool that uses modified versions of CRISPR effectors without [[endonuclease]] activity, with added [[Transcriptional activator|transcriptional]] [[Transcription factor|activators]] on dCas9 or the [[guide RNA]]s '''(gRNAs)'''.<ref name=""pmid34407984""/>

Like for [[CRISPR interference]], the CRISPR effector is guided to the target by a complementary guide RNA. However, CRISPR activation systems are fused to transcriptional activators to increase [[Gene expression|expression]] of genes of interest. Such systems are usable for many purposes including but not limited to, [[genetic screen]]s and overexpression of proteins of interest.
The most commonly-used effector is based on [[Cas9]] (from Type II systems), but other effectors like [[CRISPR/Cpf1|Cas12a]] (Type V) have been used as well.<ref name=""pmid30559432"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Breinig M, Schweitzer AY, Herianto AM, Revia S, Schaefer L, Wendler L, Cobos Galvez A, Tschaharganeh DF |display-authors = 6| title = Multiplexed orthogonal genome editing and transcriptional activation by Cas12a | journal = Nat Methods | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–54 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30559432 | doi = 10.1038/s41592-018-0262-1 | s2cid = 56174507}}</ref>

==Components==

===dCas9===

Cas9 Endonuclease Dead, also known as dead Cas9 or '''dCas9''', is a mutant form of [[Cas9]] whose endonuclease activity is removed through [[point mutation]]s in its endonuclease domains.  Similar to its unmutated form, dCas9 is used in CRISPR systems along with [[Guide RNA|gRNAs]] to target specific genes or [[nucleotide]]s complementary to the gRNA with [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM sequences]] that allow Cas9 to bind. Cas9 ordinarily has 2 endonuclease domains called the RuvC and HNH domains.  The point mutations D10A and H840A change 2 important [[Amino acid|residues]] for endonuclease activity that ultimately results in its deactivation.  Although dCas9 lacks endonuclease activity, it is still capable of binding to its guide RNA and the [[DNA|DNA strand]] that is being targeted because such binding is managed by other domains.  This alone is often enough to attenuate if not outright block transcription of the targeted gene if the gRNA positions dCas9 in a way that prevents transcriptional factors and RNA polymerase from accessing the DNA.  However, this ability to bind DNA can also be exploited for activation since dCas9 has modifiable regions, typically the [[N-terminus|N]] and [[C-terminus|C terminus]] of the protein, that can be used to attach transcriptional activators.<ref name = ""Addgene"">{{cite web | work = Addgene | title = CRISPR/Cas9 Guide | url = https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/ }}</ref>

===Guide RNA===
See: [[Guide RNA]], [[CRISPR#Genome engineering|CRISPR]]

A small guide RNA ('''sgRNA'''), or gRNA is an RNA with around 20 nucleotides used to direct Cas9 or dCas9 to their targets.  gRNAs contain two major regions of importance for CRISPR systems: the scaffold and spacer regions.  The spacer region has nucleotides that are complementary to those found on the target genes, often in the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region.  The scaffold region is responsible for formation of a complex with (d)Cas9.  Together, they bind (d)Cas9 and direct it to the gene(s) of interest.  Since the spacer region of a gRNA can be modified for any potential sequence, they give CRISPR systems much more flexibility as any genes and nucleotides with a sequence complementary to the spacer region can become possible targets.<ref name = ""Addgene"" />

===Transcriptional activators===

See: [[Transcriptional activator|Transcriptional Activator]], [[Transcription factor|Transcription Factor]]

'''Transcriptional Activators''' are protein domains or whole proteins linked to dCas9 or sgRNAs that assist in the recruitment of important co-factors as well as [[RNA Polymerase]] for [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] of the [[Gene|gene(s)]] targeted by the system. In order for a protein to be made from the gene that encodes it, RNA polymerase must make RNA from the DNA template of the gene during a process called transcription. Transcriptional activators have a DNA binding domain and a domain for activation of transcription. The activation domain can recruit general [[transcription factor]]s or RNA polymerase to the gene sequence. Activation domains can also function by facilitating transcription by stalled RNA polymerases, and in eukaryotes can act to move [[nucleosome]]s on the DNA or modify [[histone]]s to increase gene expression.<ref>Ma, J. (August 2011). Transcriptional activators and activation mechanisms. Protein and Cell, '''2'''(11), 879-888.</ref> These activators can be introduced into the system through attachment to dCas9 or to the sgRNA.  Some researchers have noted that the extent of transcriptional upregulation can be modulated by using multiple sites for activator attachment in one experiment and by using different variations and combinations of activators at once in a given experiment or sample.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perez-Pinera P, Kocak DD, Vockley CM, Adler AF, Kabadi AM, Polstein LR, Thakore PI, Glass KA, Ousterout DG, Leong KW, Guilak F, Crawford GE, Reddy TE, Gersbach CA | display-authors = 6 | title = RNA-guided gene activation by CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription factors | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 973–6 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23892895 | pmc = 3911785 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2600 }}</ref><ref name=""pmid23892898"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maeder ML, Linder SJ, Cascio VM, Fu Y, Ho QH, Joung JK | title = CRISPR RNA-guided activation of endogenous human genes | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 977–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23892898 | pmc = 3794058 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2598 }}</ref><ref name = ""Konermann_2015"" />

===Expression system===

An [[Gene expression#Expression system|expression system]] is required for the introduction of the gRNAs and (d)Cas9 proteins into the cells of interest. Typically employed options include but are not limited to [[plasmid]]s and [[viral vectors]] such as [[adeno-associated virus]] (AAV) vector or [[lentivirus]] vector.

==Specific activation systems==
===VP64-p65-Rta===
The VP64-p65-Rta, or VPR, dCas9 activator was created by modifying an existing dCas9 activator, in which a Vp64 transcriptional activator is joined to the C terminus of dCas9.<ref name=""pmid34407984"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen TI, Mikkelsen NS, Gao Z, Foßelteder J, Pabst G, Axelgaard E, Laustsen A, König S, Reinisch A, Bak RO | title = Targeted regulation of transcription in primary cells using CRISPRa and CRISPRi | journal = Genome Res | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 2120–2130 | date = November 2021 | pmid = 34407984 | doi = 10.1101/gr.275607.121 }}</ref> In the dCas9-VPR protein, the transcription factors p65 and Rta are added to the C terminus of dCas9-Vp64. Therefore, all three transcription factors are targeted to the same gene. The use of three transcription factors, as opposed to solely Vp64, results in increased expression of targeted genes. When different genes were targeted by dCas9, they all showed significantly greater expression with dCas9-VPR than with dCas9-VP64. It has also been demonstrated that dCas9-VPR can be used to increase expression of multiple genes within the same cell by putting multiple sgRNAs into the same cell.<ref name = ""Chavez_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavez A, Scheiman J, Vora S, Pruitt BW, Tuttle M, EP, Lin S, Kiani S, Guzman CD, Wiegand DJ, Ter-Ovanesyan D, Braff JL, Davidsohn N, Housden BE, Perrimon N, Weiss R, Aach J, Collins JJ, Church GM | display-authors = 6 | title = Highly efficient Cas9-mediated transcriptional programming | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–8 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25730490 | pmc = 4393883 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3312 }}</ref>

[[File:DCas9-VPR activator.svg|thumb|none|The dCas9-VPR activator increases transcription at the gene that it targets.]]

===Synergistic activation mediator===

To overcome the limitation of the dCas9-VP64 gene activation system, the dCas9-SAM system was developed to incorporate multiple transcriptional factors. Utilizing [[MS2 tagging|MS2]], [[RELA|p65]], and [[HSF1]] proteins, dCas9-SAM system recruits various transcriptional factors working synergistically to activate the gene of interest.[[File:DCas SAM system.png|thumb|left|The dCas-SAM system uses msgRNA that has attached aptamers for different transcriptional factors (MS2,p65 and HSF1) to bind.]]

In order to assemble different transcriptional activators, the dCas9-SAM system uses a modified [[Guide RNA|single guide RNA (sgRNA)]] that has binding sites for the MS2 protein. Hairpin [[aptamer]]s are attached to the tetra loop and the stem loop 2 of the sgRNA to become binding sites for dimerized MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins. As the hairpins are exposed outside of the dCas9-sgRNA complex, other transcriptional factors can bind to the MS2 protein without disrupting the dCas9-sgRNA complex. Thus, the MS2 protein is engineered to include p65 and HSF1 proteins. The MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein interacts with the dCas9-VP64 to recruit more transcriptional factors onto the promoter of the target genes.

Employing the dCas-SAM system, Zhang et al. (2015) successfully reactivated the latent HIV gene to over-express viral proteins from the HIV host cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Yin C, Zhang T, Li F, Yang W, Kaminski R, Fagan PR, Putatunda R, Young WB, Khalili K, Hu W | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/gRNA-directed synergistic activation mediator (SAM) induces specific, persistent and robust reactivation of the HIV-1 latent reservoirs | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 16277 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26538064 | pmc = 4633726 | doi = 10.1038/srep16277 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516277Z }}</ref> They were able to over-express viral proteins substantially to trigger apoptosis of HIV-1 latent cells due to the toxicity of viral proteins. In another dCas-SAM system experiment, Konermann et al. (2015) found genes in melanoma cells that give resistance to a BRAF inhibitor through activating candidate genes via dCas system.<ref name = ""Konermann_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Konermann S, Brigham MD, Trevino AE, Joung J, Abudayyeh OO, Barcena C, Hsu PD, Habib N, Gootenberg JS, Nishimasu H, Nureki O, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex | journal = Nature | volume = 517 | issue = 7536 | pages = 583–8 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25494202 | pmc = 4420636 | doi = 10.1038/nature14136 | bibcode = 2015Natur.517..583K }}</ref> Thus, the dCas9-SAM system can further be employed to activate latent genes, develop gene therapies, and discover new genes.

===SunTag===
The SunTag activator system uses the dCas9 protein, which is modified to be linked with the SunTag. The SunTag is a repeating polypeptide array that can recruit multiple copies of [[Antibody|antibodies]]. Through attaching transcriptional factors on the antibodies, the SunTag dCas9 activating complex amplifies its recruitment of transcriptional factors. In order to guide the dCas9 protein to its target gene, the dCas9 SunTag system uses [[Guide RNA|sgRNA]].

Tanenbaum et al.(2014) are credited for creating the dCas9 SunTag system. For the [[antibody|antibodies]], they employed [[Gcn4|GCN4]] antibodies which was bound to transcriptional factor VP64. In order to transport the antibodies to the nuclei of the cells, they attached [[Nuclear localization sequence|NLS]] tag. To confirm the nuclear localization of the antibodies, [[Green fluorescent protein|sfGFP]] was used for visualization purpose. Therefore, the GCN4-sfGFP-NLS-VP64 protein was developed to be interact with dCas SunTag system. The antibodies successfully bound to SunTag polypeptides and activated target CXCR4 gene in K562 cell lines.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanenbaum ME, Gilbert LA, Qi LS, Weissman JS, Vale RD | title = A protein-tagging system for signal amplification in gene expression and fluorescence imaging | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 635–46 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307933 | pmc = 4252608 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.039 }}</ref> Comparing with the dCas9-VP64 activation complex, they were able to increase the [[CXCR4]] gene expression 5-25 times greater in K562 cell lines. Not only was there a greater CXCR4 protein overexpression but also CXCR4 proteins were active to further travel on the transwell migration assay. Thus, the dCas9-SunTag system can be used to activate genes that are present latently such as virus genes.

==Applications==

The dCas9 activation system allows a desired gene or multiple genes in the same cell to be expressed. It is possible to study genes involved in a certain process using a [[genome]] wide screen that involves activating expression of genes. Examining which sgRNAs yield a phenotype suggests which genes are involved in a specific pathway. The dCas9 activation system can be used to control exactly which cells are activated and at what time activation occurs. dCas9 constructs have been made that turn on a dCas9-activator fusion protein in the presence of light or chemicals. Cells can also be reprogrammed or differentiated from one cell type into another by increasing the expression of certain genes important for the formation or maintenance of a cell type.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26670017 | pmc = 4922510 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2015.2 }}</ref>

===Greater control over gene expression===

One research group used a system in which dCas9 was fused to a particular domain, C1B1. When blue light is shined on the cell, the [[cryptochrome]] 2 (Cry2) domain binds to C1B1. The Cry2 domain is fused to a [[Transcription factor|transcriptional activator]], so blue light targets the activator to the spot where dCas9 is bound. The use of light allows a great deal of control over when the targeted gene is activated. Removing the light from the cell results in only dCas9 remaining at the target gene, so expression is not increased. In this way, the system is reversible.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nihongaki Y, Yamamoto S, Kawano F, Suzuki H, Sato M | title = CRISPR-Cas9-based photoactivatable transcription system | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–74 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25619936 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2014.12.011 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A similar system was developed using chemical control. In this system, dCas9 recruits an MS2 fusion protein that contains the domain FKBP. In the presence of the chemical RAP, an FRB domain fused to a chromatin modifying complex binds to FKBP. Whenever RAP is added to the cells, a specific [[Chromatin remodeling|chromatin modifier complex]] can be targeted to the gene. That allows scientists to examine how specific [[chromatin]] modifications affect the expression of a gene.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Braun SM, Kirkland JG, Chory EJ, Husmann D, Calarco JP, Crabtree GR | title = Rapid and reversible epigenome editing by endogenous chromatin regulators | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 560 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28916764 | pmc = 5601922 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-017-00644-y | bibcode = 2017NatCo...8..560B }}</ref> The dCAs9-VPR system is used as an activator by targeting it to the promoter of a gene upstream of the coding region. A study used various sgRNAs to target different portions of the gene, finding that the dCas9-VPR activator can act as an activator or a repressor, depending on the location it binds. In a cell, sgRNAs targeting the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] could allow dCas9-VPR to increase expression, while sgRNAs targeting the coding region of the gene result in dCas9-VPR decreasing expression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deaner M, Mejia J, Alper HS | title = Enabling Graded and Large-Scale Multiplex of Desired Genes Using a Dual-Mode dCas9 Activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = ACS Synthetic Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 1931–1943 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28700213 | doi = 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00163 }}</ref>

===Genome wide activation===
The versatility of sgRNAs allows dCas9 activators to increase the expression of any gene within an organism's genome. That could be used to increase expression of a protein coding gene or a transcribed RNA. A paper demonstrated that genome wide activation could be used to determine which proteins are involved in mediated resistance to a specific drug.<ref name=""Konermann_2015""/> Another paper used genome wide activation of [[Long non-coding RNA|long, noncoding RNAs]] and observed that increasing the expression of certain long noncoding RNAs conferred resistance to the drug vemurafenib.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Joung J, Engreitz JM, Konermann S, Abudayyeh OO, Verdine VK, Aguet F, Gootenberg JS, Sanjana NE, Wright JB, Fulco CP, Tseng YY, Yoon CH, Boehm JS, Lander ES, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-scale activation screen identifies a lncRNA locus regulating a gene neighbourhood | journal = Nature | volume = 548 | issue = 7667 | pages = 343–346 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28792927 | pmc = 5706657 | doi = 10.1038/nature23451 | bibcode = 2017Natur.548..343J }}</ref> In both cases, the cells that survive the drug could be studied to determine which sgRNAs they contain. That allows researchers to determine which gene was activated in each surviving cell, which suggests which genes are important for resistance to that drug.

===Use in organisms===
A dCas9 fusion with VP64, p65, and [[HSF1]] (heat shock factor 1) allowed researchers to target genes in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] and increase transcription to a similar level as when the gene itself is inserted into the plant's genome. For one of the two genes tested, the dCas9 activator changes the number and size of leaves and made the plants better able to handle drought. The authors conclude that the dCas9 activator can create phenotypes in plants that are similar to those observed when a transgene is inserted for overexpression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JJ, Dempewolf E, Zhang W, Wang ZY | title = RNA-guided transcriptional activation via CRISPR/dCas9 mimics overexpression phenotypes in Arabidopsis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e0179410 | pmid = 28622347 | pmc = 5473554 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0179410 | year = 2017 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1279410P | doi-access = free }}</ref> Researchers have used multiple guide RNAs to target dCas9 activation system to multiple genes in a specific mouse strain in which dCas9 can be turned on in specific cell lines using the [[Cre recombinase]] system.

the technique provides a complementary approach to [[RNA interference]]. The difference between CRISPRi and RNAi, though, is that CRISPRi regulates gene expression primarily on the transcriptional level, while RNAi controls genes on the mRNA level.

==Background==
{{see also|CRISPR|CRISPR gene editing}}
Many [[bacteria]] and most [[archaea]] have an adaptive immune system which incorporates CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes.

The CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technique was first reported by Lei S. Qi and researchers at the [[University of California at San Francisco]] in early 2013.<ref name=""pmid23452860""/> The technology uses a catalytically dead [[Cas9]] (usually denoted as dCas9) protein that lacks endonuclease activity to regulate genes in an RNA-guided manner. Targeting specificity is determined by complementary base-pairing of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to the genomic locus. sgRNA is a chimeric noncoding RNA that can be subdivided into three regions: a 20 nt base-pairing sequence, a 42 nt dCas9-binding hairpin and a 40 nt terminator (bacteria,<ref name=""pmid23360965"">{{Cite journal

When designing a synthetic sgRNA, only the 20 nt base-pairing sequence is modified. Secondary variables must also be considered: off-target effects (for which a simple BLAST run of the base-pairing sequence is required), maintenance of the dCas9-binding hairpin structure, and ensuring that no restriction sites are present in the modified sgRNA, as this may pose a problem in downstream cloning steps. Due to the simplicity of sgRNA design, this technology is amenable to genome-wide scaling.<ref name=""pmid24136345"">{{Cite journal

==Transcriptional regulation==
===Repression===
CRISPRi can sterically repress [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] by blocking either transcriptional initiation or elongation. This is accomplished by designing sgRNA complementary to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] or the [[exon]]ic sequences. The level of transcriptional repression with a target within the coding sequence is strand-specific.
Depending on the nature of the CRISPR effector, either the template or non-template strand leads to stronger repression.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00077-19| issn = 1092-2172 | volume = 84| issue = 2| last1 = Vigouroux| first1 = Antoine| last2 = Bikard| first2 = David| title = CRISPR Tools To Control Gene Expression in Bacteria| journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews| date = 2020-05-20| pmid = 32238445| pmc = 7117552| url = }}</ref>
For dCas9 (based on a Type-2 CRISPR system), repression is stronger when the guide RNA is complementary to the non-template strand. It has been suggested that this is due to the activity of helicase, which unwinds the RNA:DNA heteroduplex ahead of [[RNA polymerase II|RNA pol II]] when the sgRNA is complementary to the template strand. Unlike transcription elongation block, silencing is independent of the targeted DNA strand when targeting the transcriptional start site. In prokaryotes, this steric inhibition can repress transcription of the target gene by almost 99.9%; in human cells, up to 90% repression was observed.<ref name=""pmid23452860""/>
In bacteria, it is possible to saturate the target with a high enough level of dCas9 complex. In this case, the repression strength only depends on the probability that dCas9 is ejected upon collision with the RNA polymerase, which is determined by the guide sequence.<ref name=""auto"">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15252/msb.20177899| issn = 1744-4292 | volume = 14| issue = 3| pages = –7899| last1 = Vigouroux| first1 = Antoine| last2 = Oldewurtel| first2 = Enno| last3 = Cui| first3 = Lun| last4 = Bikard| first4 = David| last5 = van Teeffelen| first5 = Sven| title = Tuning dCas9's ability to block transcription enables robust, noiseless knockdown of bacterial genes| journal = Molecular Systems Biology| date = March 2018| pmid = 29519933| pmc = 5842579| url = }}</ref> Higher temperatures are also associated with higher ejection probability, thus weaker repression.<ref name=""auto""/>
In eukaryotes, CRISPRi can also repress transcription via an effector domain. Fusing a repressor domain to dCas9 allows transcription to be further repressed by inducing heterochromatinization. For example, the well-studied [[Krüppel associated box]] (KRAB) domain can be fused to dCas9 to repress transcription of the target gene up to 99% in human cells.<ref name=""pmid23849981"">{{Cite journal

===Improvements on the efficiency===
Whereas genome-editing by the catalytically active Cas9 nuclease can be accompanied by irreversible off-target genomic alterations, CRISPRi is highly specific with minimal off-target reversible effects for two distinct sgRNA sequences.<ref name=""pmid23849981""/> Nonetheless, several methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of transcriptional modulation. Identification of the [[transcription start site]] of a target gene and considering the preferences of sgRNA improves efficiency, as does the presence of accessible [[chromatin]] at the target site.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Radzisheuskaya|first1=Aliaksandra|last2=Shlyueva|first2=Daria|last3=Müller|first3=Iris|title=Optimizing sgRNA position markedly improves the efficiency of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression|date=28 June 2016|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=44|issue=18|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw583|pmc=5062975|pmid=27353328|page=e141}}</ref>

====Other methods====
Along with other [[#Advantages and Limitations|improvements]] mentioned, factors such as the distance from the transcription start and the local chromatin state may be critical parameters in determining activation/repression efficiency. Optimization of dCas9 and sgRNA expression, stability, nuclear localization, and interaction will likely allow for further improvement of CRISPRi efficiency in mammalian cells.<ref name=""pmid23452860""/>

==Applications==
===Gene knockdown===
A significant portion of the genome (both reporter and endogenous genes) in eukaryotes has been shown to be targetable using lentiviral constructs to express dCas9 and sgRNAs, with comparable efficiency to existing techniques such as RNAi and TALE proteins.<ref name=""pmid23849981""/> In tandem or as its own system, CRISPRi could be used to achieve the same [[RNA Interference#Applications|applications]] as in RNAi.

For bacteria, gene knockdown by CRISPRi has been fully implemented and characterized (off-target analysis, leaky repression) for both Gram-negative ''E. coli'' <ref name=""pmid23360965"" /><ref name=""pmid27996021"" /> and Gram-positive ''B. subtilis''.<ref name=""pmid27238023"" />

[[File:CRISPRflowchart.pdf|thumb|CRISPRi construction workflow]]

===Allelic series===
Differential gene expression can be achieved by modifying the efficiency of sgRNA base-pairing to the target loci.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/> In theory, modulating this efficiency can be used to create an allelic series for any given gene, in essence creating a collection of hypo- and hypermorphs. These powerful collections can be used to probe any genetic investigation. For [[Muller's morphs|hypomorphs]], this allows the incremental reduction of gene function as opposed to the binary nature of gene knockouts and the unpredictability of knockdowns. For [[Muller's morphs|hypermorphs]], this is in contrast to the conventional method of cloning the gene of interest under promoters with variable strength.

===Genome loci imaging===

==Advantages and limitations==
===Advantages===
#CRISPRi can silence a target gene of interest up to 99.9% repression.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/> The strength of the repression can also be tuned by changing the amount of complementarity between the guide RNA and the target. Contrary to inducible promoters, partial repression by CRISPRi does not add [[transcriptional noise]] to the target's expression.<ref name=""auto""/> Since the repression level is encoded in a DNA sequence, various expression levels can be grown in competition and identified by sequencing.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1101/805333| pages = 805333| last1 = Hawkins| first1 = John S.| last2 = Silvis| first2 = Melanie R.| last3 = Koo| first3 = Byoung-Mo| last4 = Peters| first4 = Jason M.| last5 = Jost| first5 = Marco| last6 = Hearne| first6 = Cameron C.| last7 = Weissman| first7 = Jonathan S.| last8 = Todor| first8 = Horia| last9 = Gross| first9 = Carol A.| title = Modulated efficacy CRISPRi reveals evolutionary conservation of essential gene expression-fitness relationships in bacteria| journal = bioRxiv| access-date = 2020-01-16| date = 2019-10-15| s2cid = 208583386| url = https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/805333v1| doi-access = free}}</ref>
#Since CRISPRi is based on Watson-Crick base-pairing of sgRNA-DNA and an NGG PAM motif, selection of targetable sites within the genome is straightforward and flexible. Carefully defined protocols have been developed.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/>
#Multiple sgRNAs can not only be used to control multiple different genes simultaneously (multiplex CRISPRi), but also to enhance the efficiency of regulating the same gene target. A popular strategy to express many sgRNAs simultaneously is to array the sgRNAs in a single construct with multiple promoters or processing elements. For example, Extra-Long sgRNA Arrays (ELSAs) use nonrepetitive parts to allow direct synthesis of 12-sgRNA arrays from a gene synthesis provider, can be directly integrated into the ''E. coli'' genome without homologous recombination occurring, and can simultaneously target many genes to achieve complex phenotypes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reis |first1=Alexander |last2=Halper |first2=Sean |last3=Vezeau |first3=Grace |last4=Cetnar |first4=Daniel |last5=Hossain |first5=Ayaan |last6=Clauer |first6=Phillip |last7=Salis |first7=Howard |title=Simultaneous repression of multiple bacterial genes using nonrepetitive extra-long sgRNA arrays |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1294–1301 |date=2019 |doi=10.1038/s41587-019-0286-9 |pmid=31591552|s2cid=203852115 }}</ref>
#While the two systems can be complementary, CRISPRi provides advantages over RNAi. As an exogenous system, CRISPRi does not compete with endogenous machinery such as microRNA expression or function. Furthermore, because CRISPRi acts at the DNA level, one can target transcripts such as noncoding RNAs, microRNAs, antisense transcripts, nuclear-localized RNAs, and polymerase III transcripts. Finally, CRISPRi possesses a much larger targetable sequence space; promoters and, in theory, introns can also be targeted.<ref name=""pmid23849981""/>
#In ''E. coli'', construction of a gene knockdown strain is extremely fast and requires only one-step oligo [[recombineering]].<ref name=""pmid27996021""/>

===Limitations===
#The requirement of a [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence limits the number of potential target sequences. Cas9 and its homologs may use different PAM sequences, and therefore could theoretically be utilized to expand the number of potential target sequences.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/>
#Sequence specificity to target loci is only 14 nt long (12 nt of sgRNA and 2nt of the PAM), which can recur around 11 times in a human genome.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/> Repression is inversely correlated with the distance of the target site from the transcription start site. Genome-wide computational predictions or selection of Cas9 homologs with a longer PAM may reduce nonspecific targeting.
#Endogenous chromatin states and modifications may prevent the sequence-specific binding of the dCas9-sgRNA complex.<ref name=""pmid24136345""/>  The level of transcriptional repression in mammalian cells varies between genes. Much work is needed to understand the role of local DNA conformation and chromatin in relation to binding and regulatory efficiency.
#CRISPRi can influence genes that are in close proximity to the target gene. This is especially important when targeting genes that either overlap other genes (sense or antisense overlapping) or are driven by a bidirectional promoter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goyal|first1=Ashish|last2=Myacheva|first2=Ksenia|last3=Groß|first3=Matthias|last4=Klingenberg|first4=Marcel|last5=Duran Arqué|first5=Berta|last6=Diederichs|first6=Sven|date=2016-09-30|title=Challenges of CRISPR/Cas9 applications for long non-coding RNA genes|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=45|issue=3|language=en|pages=gkw883|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw883|issn=0305-1048|pmid=28180319|pmc=5388423}}</ref>

'''CRISPR-Cas design tools''' are computer software platforms and [[bioinformatics]] tools used to facilitate the design of [[guide RNA]]s (gRNAs) for use with the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas]] gene editing system.
__TOC__
==CRISPR-Cas==
The CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated nucleases) system was originally discovered to be an acquired immune response mechanism used by [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. It has since been adopted for use as a tool in the [[genetic engineering]] of higher organisms.

Designing an appropriate gRNA is an important element of genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas system. A gRNA can and at times does have unintended interactions (""off-targets"") with other locations of the genome of interest. For a given candidate gRNA, these tools report its list of potential off-targets in the genome thereby allowing the designer to evaluate its suitability prior to embarking on any experiments.

Scientists have also begun exploring the mechanics of the CRISPR/Cas system and what governs how good, or active, a gRNA is at directing the Cas nuclease to a specific location of the genome of interest.<ref name=""pmid25184501"">{{cite journal|display-authors=6|vauthors=Doench JG, Hartenian E, Graham DB, Tothova Z, Hegde M, Smith I, Sullender M, Ebert BL, Xavier RJ, Root DE|date=December 2014|title=Rational design of highly active sgRNAs for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene inactivation|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=32|issue=12|pages=1262–7|doi=10.1038/nbt.3026|pmc=4262738|pmid=25184501}}</ref><ref name="":0"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chari R, Mali P, Moosburner M, Church GM | title = Unraveling CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering parameters via a library-on-library approach | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 823–6 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26167643 | pmc = 5292764 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3473 }}</ref> As a result of this work, new methods of assessing a gRNA for its 'activity' have been published,<ref name=""pmid25184501"" /><ref name="":0"" /> and it is now best practice to consider both the unintended interactions of a gRNA as well as the predicted activity of a gRNA at the design stage.

'''Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens''' aim to elucidate the relationship between genotype and phenotype by ablating gene expression on a genome-wide scale and studying the resulting phenotypic alterations. The approach utilises the [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR-Cas9]] gene editing system, coupled with libraries of [[Guide RNA|single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)]], which are designed to target every gene in the genome. Over recent years, the genome-wide CRISPR screen has emerged as a powerful tool for performing large-scale loss-of-function screens, with low noise, high knockout efficiency and minimal off-target effects.

[[File:Genome-wide_CRISPR_screen_-_Overview.png|right|Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout Screens: Workflow Overview. 1. sgRNA Library Creation: sgRNAs are computationally designed, synthesised, amplified by PCR, and cloned into a vector delivery system. This can be skipped by obtaining a commercially available library. 2. Screen: Cells are transduced with lentiviral particles containing the sgRNA library, Cas9, and other necessary components. Cells may be transduced in bulk (pooled screen), or in individual wells (arrayed screen). 3: Measurement & Analysis. Desired clones are selected and DNA is extracted. In a pooled screen, DNA sequencing will be necessary. sgRNAs are recovered, analysed, and associated genes identified.|alt=|thumb|692x692px]]

===sgRNA libraries===

==== Constructing a Library ====
To perform CRISPR knockouts on a genome-wide scale, collections of sgRNAs known as sgRNA libraries, or CRISPR knockout libraries, must be generated. The first step in creating a sgRNA library is to identify genomic regions of interest based on known sgRNA targeting rules.<ref name=""Joung_2017"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Joung J, Konermann S, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Platt RJ, Brigham MD, Sanjana NE, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 828–863 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28333914 | pmc = 5526071 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2017.016 }}</ref> For example, sgRNAs are most efficient when targeting the coding regions of genes and not the 5’ and 3’ [[Untranslated region|UTRs]].

Furthermore, specific nucleotides appear to be favoured at specific locations.

Multiple sgRNAs (at least 4–6) should be created against every single gene to limit false-positive detection, and negative control sgRNAs with no known targets should be included.<ref name=""Joung_2017""/><ref name=""Doench_2016""/> The sgRNAs are then created by ''in situ'' synthesis, amplified by PCR, and cloned into a vector delivery system.

==== Existing libraries ====

Developing a new sgRNA library is a laborious and time-consuming process. In practice, researchers may select an existing library depending on their experimental purpose and cell lines of interest.
As of February 2020, the most widely used resources for genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been the two [https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1-3yBRCmARIsAN7B4H3q-L7oXzYqaazZYhsLG6hugYsIOXTQrBe2cJMQywz37qDGmWcuhvwaAmfkEALw_wcB/ Genome-Scale CRISPR Knock-Out (GeCKO)] libraries created by the Zhang lab.<ref name=""Sanjana_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanjana NE, Shalem O, Zhang F | title = Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 783–784 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25075903 | pmc = 4486245 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3047 }}</ref> Available through Addgene, these lentiviral libraries respectively target human and mouse exons, and both are available as a one-vector system (where the sgRNAs and Cas9 are present on the same plasmid) or as a two-vector system (where the sgRNAs and Cas9 are present on separate plasmids). Each library is delivered as two half-libraries, allowing researchers to screen with 3 or 6 sgRNAs/gene.<ref name=""addgene"">{{cite web | title = Pooled Libraries | url = https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/ | work = Addgene }}</ref>

Aside from GeCKO, a number of other CRISPR libraries have been generated and made available through Addgene. The Sabatini & Lander labs currently have 7 separate human and mouse libraries, including targeted sublibraries for distinct subpools such as kinases and ribosomal genes (Addgene #51043–51048). Further, improvements to the specificity of sgRNAs have resulted in ‘second generation’ libraries, such as the Brie (Addgene #73632) and Brunello (Addgene #73178) libraries generated by the Doench and Root labs, and the Toronto knockout (TKO) library (Addgene #1000000069) generated by the Moffat lab.<ref name=""addgene""/>

=== Lentiviral vectors ===

=== Phenotypic selection===

In general, there are two different formats of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens: arrayed and pooled. In an arrayed screen, each well contains a specific and known sgRNA targeting a specific gene.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015""/> Since the sgRNA responsible for each phenotype is known based on well location, phenotypes can be identified and analysed without requiring genetic sequencing. This format allows for the measurement of more specific cellular phenotypes, perhaps by fluorescence or luminescence, and allows researchers to use more library types and delivery methods.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrotis A, Ketteler R | title = A new age in functional genomics using CRISPR/Cas9 in arrayed library screening | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 6 | pages = 300 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26442115 | pmc = 4585242 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2015.00300 | doi-access = free }}</ref> For large-scale LOF screens, however, arrayed formats are considered low-efficiency, and expensive in terms of financial and material resources because cell populations have to be isolated and cultured individually.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015""/>

In a pooled screen, cells grown in a single vessel are transduced in bulk with viral vectors collectively containing the entire sgRNA library. To ensure that the amount of cells infected by more than one sgRNA-containing particle is limited, a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (typically 0.3-0.6) is used.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015""/><ref name=""pmid31594818"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeung AT, Choi YH, Lee AH, Hale C, Ponstingl H, Pickard D, Goulding D, Thomas M, Gill E, Kim JK, Bradley A, Hancock RE, Dougan G | display-authors = 6 | title = Salmonella Infection | journal = mBio | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31594818 | pmc = 6786873 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.02169-19 }}</ref> Evidence so far has suggested that each sgRNA should be represented in a minimum of 200 cells.<ref name=""Hart_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart T, Chandrashekhar M, Aregger M, Steinhart Z, Brown KR, MacLeod G, Mis M, Zimmermann M, Fradet-Turcotte A, Sun S, Mero P, Dirks P, Sidhu S, Roth FP, Rissland OS, Durocher D, Angers S, Moffat J | display-authors = 6 | title = High-Resolution CRISPR Screens Reveal Fitness Genes and Genotype-Specific Cancer Liabilities | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 6 | pages = 1515–26 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26627737 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.015 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=""Yau_2018""/> Transduced cells will be selected for, followed by positive or negative selection for the phenotype of interest, and genetic sequencing will be necessary to identify the integrated sgRNAs.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015""/>

==Applications==

=== Cellular signalling mechanisms ===

Over recent years, the genome-wide CRISPR screen has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the intricate networks of cellular signalling.<ref name=""Sharma_2018"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Petsalaki E | title = Application of CRISPR-Cas9 Based Genome-Wide Screening Approaches to Study Cellular Signalling Mechanisms | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 933 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29561791 | pmc = 5979383 | doi = 10.3390/ijms19040933 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Cellular signalling is essential for a number of fundamental biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and [[apoptosis]].

One practical example is the identification of genes required for proliferative signalling in cancer cells. Cells are transduced with a CRISPR sgRNA library, and studied for growth over time.

=== Identifying synthetic lethal partners ===

[[Targeted therapy|Targeted cancer therapies]] are designed to target the specific genes, proteins, or environments contributing to tumour cell growth or survival. After a period of prolonged treatment with these therapies, however, tumour cells may develop resistance. Although the mechanisms behind cancer drug resistance are poorly understood, potential causes include: target alteration, drug degradation, apoptosis escape, and epigenetic alterations.<ref name=""pmid30518036"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leary M, Heerboth S, Lapinska K, Sarkar S | title = Sensitization of Drug Resistant Cancer Cells: A Matter of Combination Therapy | journal = Cancers | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 483 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30518036 | pmc = 6315347 | doi = 10.3390/cancers10120483 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Resistance is well-recognised and poses a serious problem in cancer management.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Host dependency factors for viral infection ===

Due to their small genomes and limited number of encoded proteins, viruses exploit host proteins for entry, replication, and transmission. Identification of such host proteins, also termed host dependency factors (HDFs), is particularly important for identifying therapeutic targets. Over recent years, many groups have successfully used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 as a screening strategy for HDFs in viral infections.<ref name=""pmid31919360"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Li B, Clohisey SM, Chia BS, Wang B, Cui A, Eisenhaure T, Schweitzer LD, Hoover P, Parkinson NJ, Nachshon A, Smith N, Regan T, Farr D, Gutmann MU, Bukhari SI, Law A, Sangesland M, Gat-Viks I, Digard P, Vasudevan S, Lingwood D, Dockrell DH, Doench JG, Baillie JK, Hacohen N | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies host dependency factors for influenza A virus infection | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 164 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31919360 | pmc = 6952391 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-019-13965-x | bibcode = 2020NatCo..11..164L }}</ref>

== Limitations ==
''This section will specifically address genome-wide CRISPR screens. For a review of CRISPR limitations see Lino et al. (2018)<ref name=""Lino_2018"" />''

=== The sgRNA library ===

Genome-wide CRISPR screens will ultimately be limited by the properties of the chosen sgRNA library. Each library will contain a different set of sgRNAs, and average coverage per gene may vary. Currently available libraries tend to be biased towards sgRNAs targeting early (5’) protein-coding exons, rather than those targeting the more functional protein domains.<ref name=""Hinze_2019""/> This problem was highlighted by Hinze ''et al.'' (2019),<ref name=""Hinze_2019""/> who noted that genes associated with [[asparaginase]] sensitivity failed to score in their genome-wide screen of asparaginase-resistant leukemia cells.

If an appropriate library is not available, creating and amplifying a new sgRNA library is a lengthy process which may take many months. Potential challenges include: (i) effective sgRNA design; (ii) ensuring comprehensive sgRNA coverage throughout the genome; (iii) lentiviral vector backbone design; (iv) producing sufficient amounts of high-quality lentivirus; (v) overcoming low transformation efficiency; (vi) proper scaling of the bacterial culture.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Quinn T | title = Advantages and challenges of pooled libraries | work = Webinar series | publisher = Takara Bio USA | url = https://www.takarabio.com/learning-centers/gene-function/gene-editing/genome-wide-screening/crispr-library-screening-webinar }}</ref>

=== Maintaining cellular sgRNA coverage ===

One of the largest hurdles for genome-wide CRISPR screening is ensuring adequate coverage of the sgRNA library across the cell population.<ref name=""Yau_2018"" /> Evidence so far has suggested that each sgRNA should be represented and maintained in a minimum of 200-300 cells.<ref name=""Yau_2018"" /><ref name=""Hart_2015"" />

Considering that the standard protocol uses a multiplicity of infection of ~0.3, and a transduction efficiency of 30-40%<ref name=""takara""/><ref name=""Yau_2018""/> the number of cells required to produce and maintain suitable coverage becomes very large. By way of example, the most popular human sgRNA library is the [https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1-3yBRCmARIsAN7B4H2cTsJq44UZen4GOpdr-IbSGuTdqS_BjcCdi9x0PtthkDXvoIztPDgaAoNIEALw_wcB/ GeCKO v2 library] created by the Zhang lab;<ref name=""Zhang_2014""/> it contains 123,411 sgRNAs.

As CRISPR continues to exhibit low noise and minimal off-target effects, an alternative strategy is to reduce the number of sgRNAs per gene for a primary screen. Less stringent cut-offs are used for hit selection, and additional sgRNAs are later used in a more specific secondary screen. This approach is demonstrated by Doench ''et al''. (2016),<ref name=""Doench_2016""/> who found that >92% of genes recovered using the standard protocol were also recovered using fewer sgRNAs per gene. They suggest that this strategy could be useful in studies where scale-up is prohibitively costly.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Lentiviral limitations ===

Lentiviral vectors have certain general limitations. For one, it is impossible to control where the viral genome integrates into the host genome, and this may affect important functions of the cell. Vannucci ''et al.''<ref name=""pmid23435812"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vannucci L, Lai M, Chiuppesi F, Ceccherini-Nelli L, Pistello M | title = Viral vectors: a look back and ahead on gene transfer technology | journal = The New Microbiologica | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–22 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23435812 }}</ref> provide an excellent review of viral vectors along with their general advantages and disadvantages. In the specific context of genome-wide CRISPR screens, producing and transducing the lentiviral particles is relatively laborious and time-consuming, taking about two weeks in total.<ref name=""takara""/> Additionally, because the DNA integrates into the host genome, lentiviral delivery leads to long-term expression of Cas9, potentially leading to off-target effects.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Arrayed vs pooled screens ===
In an arrayed screen, each well contains a specific and known sgRNA targeting a specific gene. Arrayed screens therefore allow for detailed profiling of a single cell, but are limited by high costs and the labour required to isolate and culture the high number of individual cell populations.<ref name=""Agrotis_2015""/> Conventional pooled CRISPR screens are relatively simple and cost effective to perform, but are limited to the study of the entire cell population. This means that rare phenotypes may be more difficult to identify, and only crude phenotypes can be selected for e.g. cell survival, proliferation, or reporter gene expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

'''Cas12a''' ('''C'''RISPR '''as'''sociated protein '''12a''', previously known as '''Cpf1''') is an RNA-guided [[endonuclease]] of that forms part of the [[CRISPR]] system in some [[bacteria]] and is used by scientists to modify DNA.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":3"" /> It originates as part of a bacterial [[Immune system|immune mechanism]], where it serves to destroy the genetic material of [[Bacteriophage|viruses]] and thus protect the cell and colony from viral infection. Cas12a and other CRISPR associated endonucleases are unique in that their use of a [[guide RNA]] makes this action highly selective; they only cut DNA when it is adjacent to a certain sequence of nucleotides. In the organisms from which it originates, this guide RNA is a copy of a piece of the genome from a virus that previously infected the cell.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite web|date=2015-09-29|title=CRISPR-Based Genetic Engineering Gets a Kick in the Cas|url=http://news.meta.com/?p=863|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141625/http://news.meta.com/?p=863#|archive-date=2017-10-22|access-date=2016-05-03|website=Meta Science News|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Description ==

=== Discovery ===

CRISPR/Cas12a was found by searching a published database of bacterial genetic sequences for promising bits of DNA. Its identification through [[bioinformatics]] as a CRISPR system protein, its naming, and a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM) for its detection were provided in 2012 in a release of the [[TIGRFAMs]] database of [[protein families]]. Cas12a appears in many bacterial species. The ultimate Cas12a endonuclease that was developed into a tool for genome editing was taken from one of the first 16 species known to harbor it.<ref name=nat>{{Cite journal|title = Alternative CRISPR system could improve genome editing|journal = Nature|pages = 17|volume = 526|issue = 7571|doi = 10.1038/nature.2015.18432|pmid = 26432219|first = Heidi|last = Ledford|year=2015|doi-access = free}}</ref> Two candidate enzymes from ''[[Acidaminococcus]]'' and ''[[Lachnospiraceae]]'' display efficient genome-editing activity in human cells.<ref name="":3"" />

A smaller version of Cas9 from the bacterium ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is a potential alternative to Cas12a.<ref name=""nat"" />

=== Classification ===

CRISPR-Cas systems are separated into two classes: Class 1 uses several Cas proteins together with the CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) to build a functional endonuclease, while Class 2 CRISPR systems use only a single Cas protein with a crRNA. Under this classification, Cas12a has been identified as a Class II, Type V CRISPR/Cas system containing a 1,300 amino acid protein.<ref name="":0"">Makarova, Kira S., et al. ""An updated evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems."" Nature Reviews Microbiology (2015).</ref>

=== Name ===
CRISPR ('''C'''lustered '''R'''egularly '''I'''nterspaced '''S'''hort '''P'''alindromic '''R'''epeats) is named for the features of the invariant DNA sequences involved in targeting. Cas12a was originally known as Cpf1 as an abbreviation of CRISPR and two [[genera]] of bacteria where it appears, [[Prevotella]] and [[Francisella]]. It was renamed in 2015 after a broader rationalization of the names of Cas ('''C'''RISPR '''as'''sociated) proteins to correspond to their [[sequence homology]].<ref name="":0"" />

== Structure ==

The Cas12a locus contains a mixed [[Alpha helix|alpha]]/[[Beta sheet|beta]] domain, a RuvC-I followed by a helical region, a RuvC-II and a [[zinc finger]]-like domain.<ref name="":1"">{{cite journal|last2=Gootenberg|first2=Jonathan S.|last3=Abudayyeh|first3=Omar O.|last4=Slaymaker|first4=Ian M.|last5=Makarova|first5=Kira S.|last6=Essletzbichler|first6=Patrick|last7=Volz|first7=Sara E.|last8=Joung|first8=Julia|last9=van der Oost|first9=John|date=October 2015|title=Cpf1 Is a Single RNA-Guided Endonuclease of a Class 2 CRISPR-Cas System|journal=Cell|volume=163|issue=3|pages=759–771|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038|last1=Zetsche|first1=Bernd|last10=Regev|first10=Aviv|last11=Koonin|first11=Eugene V.|last12=Zhang|first12=Feng|pmid=26422227|pmc=4638220}}</ref> The Cas12a protein has a [[Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease|RuvC]]-like endonuclease domain that is similar to the RuvC domain of Cas9. Furthermore, Cas12a does not have a HNH endonuclease domain, and the N-terminal of Cas12a does not have the alpha-helical recognition lobe of Cas9.<ref name="":0"" />

Cas12a CRISPR-Cas domain architecture shows that Cas12a is functionally unique, being classified as Class 2, type V CRISPR system. The Cas12a loci encode [[Cas1]], Cas2 and [[Cas4]] proteins more similar to types I and III than from type II systems. Database searches suggest the abundance of Cas12a-family proteins in many bacterial species.<ref name="":0"" />

Functional Cas12a doesn't need the [[Trans-activating crRNA|tracrRNA]], therefore, only crRNA is required. This benefits genome editing because Cas12a is not only smaller than Cas9, but also it has a smaller [[Subgenomic mRNA|sgRNA]] molecule (proximately half as many [[nucleotide]]s as Cas9).<ref name="":4"">{{Cite web|url=http://epigenie.com/cpf1-takes-crispr-bigger-by-going-smaller/|title=Cpf1 Moves in on Cas9 for Next-Gen CRISPR Genome Editing|website=epigenie.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref>

The Cas12a-crRNA complex cleaves target DNA or RNA by identification of a [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) 5'-YTN-3'<ref name=""pmid27096362"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fonfara I, Richter H, Bratovič M, Le Rhun A, Charpentier E | title=The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cas12a also processes precursor CRISPR RNA | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=532 | issue=7600 | year=2016 | pages=517–521 | doi = 10.1038/nature17945  | pmid=27096362}}</ref> (where ""Y"" is a pyrimidine<ref>{{cite web | title = Nucleotide Codes, Amino Acid Codes, and Genetic Codes |  publisher = KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  | date = July 15, 2014 | url = http://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/codes1.html  | access-date = 2016-05-25 }}</ref> and ""N"" is any [[nucleobase]]), in contrast to the G-rich PAM targeted by Cas9. After identification of PAM, Cas12a introduces a sticky-end-like DNA double- stranded break of 4 or 5 nucleotides overhang.<ref name="":1"" />

== Mechanism ==

The CRISPR/Cas12a system consist of a Cas12a enzyme and a guide RNA that finds and positions the complex at the correct spot on the double helix to cleave target DNA. CRISPR/Cas12a systems activity has three stages:<ref name=""nat"" /> 
* Adaptation: Cas1 and Cas2 proteins facilitate the adaptation of small fragments of DNA into the CRISPR array. . 
* Formation of crRNAs: processing of pre-cr-RNAs producing of mature crRNAs to guide the Cas protein.
* Interference: the Cas12a is bound to a crRNA to form a binary complex to identify and cleave a target DNA sequence.
[[File:Cas-gRNA Mechanism.jpg|thumb]]

=== Cas9 vs. Cas12a ===

Cas9 requires two [[RNA]] molecules to cut DNA while Cas12a needs one. The proteins also cut DNA at different places, offering researchers more options when selecting an editing site. Cas9 cuts both strands in a DNA molecule at the same position, leaving behind [[Sticky and blunt ends#Blunt ends|blunt ends]]. Cas12a leaves one strand longer than the other, creating [[Sticky and blunt ends#Overhangs and sticky ends|sticky ends]]. The sticky ends have different properties than blunt ends during [[non-homologous end joining]] or [[Homologous recombination|homologous repair]] of DNA, which confers certain advantages to Cas12a when attempting gene insertions, compared to Cas9.<ref name=""nat"" /> Although the CRISPR/Cas9 system can efficiently disable genes, it is challenging to insert genes or generate a knock-in.<ref name="":2"" /> Cas12a lacks [[tracrRNA]], utilizes a T-rich PAM and cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA DSB.<ref name="":4"" />

In summary, important differences between Cas12a and Cas9 systems are that Cas12a:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamano | first1 = T. | last2 = Nishimasu | first2 = H. | last3 = Zetsche | first3 = B. | last4 = Hirano | first4 = H. | last5 = Slaymaker | first5 = I.

* Recognizes different PAMs, enabling new targeting possibilities.
* Creates 4-5 nt long sticky ends, instead of blunt ends produced by Cas9, enhancing the efficiency of genetic insertions and specificity during [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ]] or HDR.
* Cuts target DNA further away from PAM, further away from the Cas9 cutting site, enabling new possibilities for cleaving the DNA.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249|pmc=6286148}}</ref><ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complementary targeting sequence.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}</ref> The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).<ref name="":0"" /> The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.<ref name="":1"" /> By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80–250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90–4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.<ref name="":2"" />

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289|pmc=6314022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title=""Cat's Cradling"" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198|doi-access=free}}</ref> Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====
One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

Nature built her sense of curiosity and her desire to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of life.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":0"" /> This was coupled with the atmosphere of intellectual pursuit that her parents encouraged at home. Her father enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with many books on [[popular science]].<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":0"" /> When Doudna was in the sixth grade, he gave her a copy of [[James Watson]]'s 1968 book on the discovery of the structure of DNA, ''[[The Double Helix]],'' which was a major inspiration.<ref name=""Doudna12"" /> Doudna also developed her interest in science and mathematics in school.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name=""Doudna12"">{{cite web |url=http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/201408/Features/Doudna/ |title=On the same wavelength |last1=Mukhopadyay |first1=Rajendrani |publisher=American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |access-date=October 24, 2017 }}</ref> While she attended [[Hilo High School]], Doudna's interest in science was nurtured by her 10th-grade chemistry teacher, Ms. Jeanette Wong, whom she has routinely cited as a significant influence in sparking her nascent scientific curiosity.<ref name=""Doudna12"" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/10/lee-cataluna-remembering-the-hilo-teacher-who-inspired-a-nobel-prize-winner/ |title= Remembering The Hilo Teacher Who Inspired A Nobel Prize Winner |last1=Cataluna |first1=Lee |publisher=Honolulu Civil Beat |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sbgrid.org/software/tale/big_questions_big_answers |title= Big Questions, Big Answers |publisher=SBGrid Consortium |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kavliprize.org/events-and-features/2018-kavli-prize-nanoscience-conversation-jennifer-doudna-emmanuelle-charpentier |title= 2018 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience: A Conversation with Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Virginijus Šikšnys |publisher=The Kavli Prize |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref> A visiting lecturer on cancer cells further encouraged her pursuit of science as a career choice.<ref name=""Doudna12"" /> She spent a summer working in the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] lab of noted [[mycology|mycologist]] Don Hemmes and graduated from [[Hilo High School]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Genome editing pioneer and Hilo High graduate Jennifer Doudna speaks at UH Hilo about her discovery: CRISPR technology|url=https://hilo.hawaii.edu/chancellor/stories/2018/09/19/genome-editing-pioneer-and-hilo-high-graduate-jennifer-doudna-speaks-at-uh-hilo-about-her-discovery-crispr-technology/|access-date=October 7, 2020|publisher=UH Hilo Stories}}</ref>

Szostak]].<ref name=""BP"" />

== Career and research ==
After her PhD, she held [[research fellow]]ships in molecular biology at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and in genetics at Harvard Medical School.<ref name=""cv"" /> From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey [[Postdoctoral researcher|Postdoctoral Scholar]] in Biomedical Science at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], where she worked with [[Thomas Cech]].<ref name=""cv"" />

=== Research on ribozyme structure and function ===
Early in her scientific career, Doudna worked to uncover the structure and biological function of [[RNA]] enzymes or [[ribozyme]]s.<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> While in the Szostak lab, Doudna re-engineered the self-splicing ''Tetrahymena'' [[Group I catalytic intron]] into a true catalytic ribozyme that copied RNA templates.<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlying mechanisms; however, she came to realize that not being able to see the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. Doudna went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a ribozyme for the first time, so ribozyme structure could be compared with that of [[Enzyme]]s, the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[Protein]]s.<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> She started this project at the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at [[Yale University]] in 1996.<ref name=""BP"" /> Doudna joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.<ref name=""cv"" /> [[File:Jennifer Doudna by Chris Michel 03.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dr Jennifer Doudna by Christopher Michel for the National Academies]]

=== X-ray diffraction-based structure of active site of a ribozyme at Yale ===
[[File:065-Self-Splicing-RNA-1u6b.tiff|thumb|Shape of a self-splicing intron with two exons (shown in red and blue). DS Goodsell, 2005, PDB]]
At Yale, Doudna's group was able to crystallize and solve the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of the ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' [[Group I catalytic intron|Group I ribozyme]].<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> They showed that a core of five magnesium ions clustered in one region of the P4-P6 domain of the ribozyme, forming a hydrophobic core around which the rest of the structure could fold.<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> This is analogous, but chemically distinct from, the way proteins typically have a core of hydrophobic amino acids.<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> Her group has crystallized other ribozymes,<ref name=""BP"" /> including the [[HDV ribozyme|Hepatitis Delta Virus ribozyme]].<ref name=""pnasbio"" /> This initial work to solve large RNA structures led to further structural studies on an internal ribosome entry site([[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]]) and protein-RNA complexes such as the [[Signal recognition particle|Signal Recognition Particle]].<ref name=""pnasbio"" />

Doudna was promoted to the position of [[Henry Ford II]] Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000. In 2000–2001, she was Robert Burns Woodward Visiting Professor of Chemistry at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=""cv"" />

In 2002, she joined her husband, Jamie Cate, at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], accepting a position as professor of biochemistry and molecular biology.<ref name=""BP"" /> Doudna also gained access to the [[Advanced Light Source|synchrotron]] at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] for her experiments with high powered x-ray diffraction.<ref name=""BP"" />

In 2009, she took a leave of absence from Berkeley to work at [[Genentech]] to lead discovery research.<ref name="":02"">{{cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/gene-editing/A-day-with-Jennifer-Doudna-Trying-to-keep-up-with-one-of-the-world-most-sought-after-scientists/98/i9|title=A DAY WITH JENNIFER DOUDNA: TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SOUGHT-AFTER SCIENTISTS |date=March 8, 2020}}</ref> She left [[Genentech]] after two months and returned to Berkeley with the help of colleague [[Michael Marletta]],{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|p=101}} cancelling all of her obligations to study [[CRISPR]].<ref name="":02""/>

As of 2020, Doudna was located at the University of California, Berkeley, where she directs the Innovative Genomics Institute, a collaboration between Berkeley and [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]]; holds the [[Li Ka-shing|Li Ka Shing]] Chancellor's Professorship in Biomedicine and Health; and is the chair of the Chancellor's Advisor Committee on Biology.<ref name=""cv"" /> Her lab now focuses on obtaining a mechanistic understanding of biological processes involving RNA.<ref name=""BP"" /> This work is divided into three major areas: the [[CRISPR]] system, [[RNA interference]], and translational control via [[MicroRNAs]].<ref name=""BP"" />

== Personal life ==
Doudna's first marriage was in 1988 to a fellow graduate student at Harvard named Tom Griffin, but his interests were more broad and less focused on research than hers and they divorced a few years later. Griffin wanted to move to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where Doudna was also interested in working with [[Thomas Cech]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|pp=54–55}} As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, Doudna met Jamie Cate, then a graduate student; they worked together on the project to crystallize and determine the structure of the Tetrahymena Group I intron P4-P6 catalytic region. Doudna brought Cate with her to Yale, and they married in Hawaii in 2000. Cate later became a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and Doudna followed him to Boston at Harvard, but in 2002 they both accepted faculty positions at Berkeley and moved there together; Cate preferred the less formal environment on the West Coast from his earlier experiences at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], and Doudna liked that Berkeley is a [[public university]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|pp=63–66}} Cate is currently a Berkeley professor and works on gene-editing yeast to increase their cellulose fermentation for biofuel production.

'''Cas9''' ('''C'''RISPR '''as'''sociated protein '''9''', formerly called Cas5, Csn1, or Csx12) is a 160 [[Dalton (unit)|kilodalton]] [[protein]] which plays a vital role in the immunological defense of certain bacteria against [[DNA virus]]es and [[plasmid]]s, and is heavily utilized in [[genetic engineering]] applications.

If the DNA substrate is complementary to the guide RNA, Cas9 cleaves the invading DNA. In this sense, the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism has a number of parallels with the [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) mechanism in eukaryotes.

Apart from its original function in bacterial immunity, the Cas9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site-directed double-strand breaks in DNA. These breaks can lead to gene inactivation or the introduction of heterologous genes through [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[homologous recombination]] respectively in many laboratory model organisms. Alongside [[zinc finger nuclease]]s and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease]] (TALEN) proteins, Cas9 is becoming a prominent tool in the field of genome editing.

Cas9 has gained traction in recent years because it can cleave nearly any sequence complementary to the guide RNA.<ref name=""P22745249"" /> Because the target specificity of Cas9 stems from the guide RNA:DNA complementarity and not modifications to the protein itself (like TALENs and [[zinc fingers]]), engineering Cas9 to target new DNA is straightforward.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Esvelt KM, Church GM | title = Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 957–63 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24076990 | pmc = 4051438 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2649 }}</ref> Versions of Cas9 that bind but do not cleave cognate DNA can be used to locate transcriptional [[activator (genetics)|activator]] or [[repressors]] to specific DNA sequences in order to control transcriptional activation and repression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Aach J, Stranges PB, Esvelt KM, Moosburner M, Kosuri S, Yang L, Church GM | title = CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 833–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23907171 | pmc = 3818127 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2675 }}</ref><ref name=""P23849981"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Larson MH, Morsut L, Liu Z, Brar GA, Torres SE, Stern-Ginossar N, Brandman O, Whitehead EH, Doudna JA, Lim WA, Weissman JS, Qi LS | title = CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 442–51 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23849981 | pmc = 3770145 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.044 }}</ref> Native Cas9 requires a guide RNA composed of two disparate RNAs that associate  – the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and the trans-activating crRNA ([[tracrRNA]]).<ref name=""Deltcheva2011""/> Cas9 targeting has been simplified through the engineering of a chimeric single guide RNA (chiRNA).

== CRISPR-mediated immunity ==
To survive in a variety of challenging, inhospitable habitats that are filled with [[bacteriophage]]s, bacteria and archaea have evolved methods to evade and fend off predatory [[virus]]es. This includes the CRISPR system of adaptive immunity. In practice, CRISPR/Cas systems act as self-programmable restriction enzymes. CRISPR loci are composed of short, palindromic repeats that occur at regular intervals composed of alternate CRISPR repeats and variable CRISPR spacers between 24 and 48 nucleotides long. These CRISPR loci are usually accompanied by adjacent CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. In 2005, it was discovered by three separate groups that the spacer regions were homologous to foreign DNA elements, including plasmids and viruses. These reports provided the first biological evidence that CRISPRs might function as an immune system.

Cas9 has been used often as a genome-editing tool. Cas9 has been used in recent developments in preventing viruses from manipulating hosts' DNA. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 was developed from bacterial genome systems, it can be used to target the genetic material in viruses. The use of the enzyme Cas9 can be a solution to many viral infections. Cas9 possesses the ability to target specific viruses by the targeting of specific strands of the viral genetic information. More specifically the Cas9 enzyme targets certain sections of the viral genome that prevents the virus from carrying out its normal function.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite book |title=CRISPR-Cas: a laboratory manual |isbn=9781621821304|location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|oclc=922914104| vauthors = Doudna JA, Mali P |year=2016}}</ref> Cas9 has also been used to disrupt the detrimental strand of DNA and RNA that cause diseases and mutated strands of DNA.

{{update|how many major types|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2021}}
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Fig. 2: The Stages of CRISPR immunity]]
CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into three major types (type I, type II, and type III) and twelve subtypes, which are based on their genetic content and structural differences. However, the core defining features of all CRISPR-Cas systems are the cas genes and their proteins: cas1 and cas2 are universal across types and subtypes, while [[cas3]], cas9, and cas10 are signature genes for type I, type II, and type III, respectively.

===CRISPR-Cas defense stages===

==== Adaptation ====
[[Adaptation]] involves recognition and integration of spacers between two adjacent repeats in the CRISPR locus. The ""Protospacer"" refers to the sequence on the viral genome that corresponds to the spacer. A short stretch of conserved nucleotides exists proximal to the protospacer, which is called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is a recognition motif that is used to acquire the DNA fragment.<ref name=""Garneau2010"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 | bibcode = 2010Natur.468...67G | s2cid = 205222849 }}</ref> In type II, Cas9 recognizes the PAM during adaptation in order to ensure the acquisition of functional spacers.<ref name=""Heler2015"" />

Loss of spacers and even groups of several have also been observed by Aranaz et al. 2004 and Pourcel et al. 2007. This probably occurs through homologous recombination of the between-repeat material.<ref name=""Deveau-et-al-2010"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deveau H, Garneau JE, Moineau S | title = CRISPR/Cas system and its role in phage-bacteria interactions | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 475–493 | date = 2010-10-13 | pmid = 20528693 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134123 | publisher = Annual Reviews }}</ref>

==== CRISPR processing/biogenesis ====
CRISPR expression includes the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a primary transcript called a CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), which is transcribed from the CRISPR locus by RNA polymerase. Specific [[endoribonuclease]]s then cleave the pre-crRNAs into small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs).<ref name=""Horvath2010"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H | s2cid = 17960960 }}</ref>

==== Interference/immunity ====
Interference involves the crRNAs within a multi-protein complex called CASCADE, which can recognize and specifically base-pair with regions of inserting complementary foreign DNA. The crRNA-foreign nucleic acid complex is then cleaved, however if there are mismatches between the spacer and the target DNA, or if there are mutations in the PAM, then cleavage will not be initiated. In the latter scenario, the foreign DNA is not targeted for attack by the cell, thus the replication of the virus proceeds and the host is not immune to viral infection. The interference stage can be mechanistically and temporally distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression, yet for complete function as a defense system, all three phases must be functional.<ref name=""Karginov2010"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Karginov FV, Hannon GJ | title = The CRISPR system: small RNA-guided defense in bacteria and archaea | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–19 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20129051 | pmc = 2819186 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.033 }}</ref>

Stage 1: CRISPR spacer integration. Protospacers and protospacer-associated motifs (shown in red) are acquired at the ""leader"" end of a CRISPR array in the host DNA. The CRISPR array is composed of spacer sequences (shown in colored boxes) flanked by repeats (black diamonds). This process requires Cas1 and Cas2 (and Cas9 in type II<ref name=""Heler2015"" />), which are encoded in the cas locus, which are usually located near the CRISPR array.

Stage 2: CRISPR expression. Pre-crRNA is transcribed starting at the leader region by the host RNA polymerase and then cleaved by Cas proteins into smaller crRNAs containing a single spacer and a partial repeat (shown as hairpin structure with colored spacers).

Stage 3: CRISPR interference. crRNA with a spacer that has strong complementarity to the incoming foreign DNA begins a cleavage event (depicted with scissors), which requires Cas proteins. DNA cleavage interferes with viral replication and provides immunity to the host. The interference stage can be functionally and temporarily distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression (depicted by white line dividing the cell).

=== Transcription deactivation using dCas9 ===
dCas9, also referred to as endonuclease deficient Cas9 can be utilized to edit gene expression when applied to the transcription binding site of the desired section of a gene. The optimal function of dCas9 is attributed to its mode of action. Gene expression is inhibited when nucleotides are no longer added to the RNA chain and therefore terminating elongation of that chain, and as a result affects the transcription process. This process occurs when dCas9 is mass-produced so it is able to affect the most amount of genes at any given time via a sequence specific guide RNA molecule. Since dCas9 appears to down regulate gene expression, this action is amplified even more when it is used in conjunction with repressive chromatin modifier domains.<ref name=""pmid28298224"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen ED, Ferreira R, Jakočiūnas T, Arsovska D, Zhang J, Ding L, Smith JD, David F, Nielsen J, Jensen MK, Keasling JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcriptional reprogramming in yeast using dCas9 and combinatorial gRNA strategies | journal = Microbial Cell Factories | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 46 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28298224 | pmc = 5353793 | doi = 10.1186/s12934-017-0664-2 }}</ref> The dCas9 protein has other functions outside of the regulation of gene expression. A promoter can be added to the dCas9 protein which allows them to work with each other to become efficient at beginning or stopping transcription at different sequences along a strand of DNA. These two proteins are specific in where they act on a gene. This is prevalent in certain types of prokaryotes when a promoter and dCas9 align themselves together to impede the ability of elongation of polymer of nucleotides coming together to form a transcribed piece of DNA. Without the promoter, the dCas9 protein does not have the same effect by itself or with a gene body.<ref name=""pmid29056323"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinto BS, Saxena T, Oliveira R, Méndez-Gómez HR, Cleary JD, Denes LT, McConnell O, Arboleda J, Xia G, Swanson MS, Wang ET | title = Impeding Transcription of Expanded Microsatellite Repeats by Deactivated Cas9 | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–490.e5 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29056323 | pmc = 6013302 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.033 }}</ref>

When examining the effects of repression of transcription further, H3K27, an amino acid component of a histone, becomes methylated through the interaction of dCas9 and a peptide called FOG1. Essentially, this interaction causes gene repression on the C + N terminal section of the amino acid complex at the specific junction of the gene, and as a result, terminates transcription.<ref name=""pmid28973434"">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Geen H, Ren C, Nicolet CM, Perez AA, Halmai J, Le VM, Mackay JP, Farnham PJ, Segal DJ | title = dCas9-based epigenome editing suggests acquisition of histone methylation is not sufficient for target gene repression | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = 17 | pages = 9901–9916 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28973434 | pmc = 5622328 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx578 }}</ref>

dCas9 also proves to be efficient when it comes to altering certain proteins that can create diseases. When the dCas9 attaches to a form of RNA called guide-RNA, it prevents the proliferation of repeating codons and DNA sequences that might be harmful to an organism's genome. Essentially, when multiple repeat codons are produced, it elicits a response, or recruits an abundance of dCas9 to combat the overproduction of those codons and results in the shut-down of transcription. dCas9 works synergistically with gRNA and directly affects the DNA polymerase II from continuing transcription.

Further explanation of how the dCas9 protein works can be found in their utilization of plant genomes by the regulation of gene production in plants to either increase or decrease certain characteristics. The CRISPR-CAS9 system has the ability to either upregulate or downregulate genes. The dCas9 proteins are a component of the CRISPR-CAS9 system and these proteins can repress certain areas of a plant gene. This happens when dCAS9 binds to repressor domains, and in the case of the plants, deactivation of a regulatory gene such as AtCSTF64, does occur.<ref name=""pmid28623586"">{{cite book | vauthors = Lowder LG, Paul JW, Qi Y | title = Plant Gene Regulatory Networks | chapter = Multiplexed Transcriptional Activation or Repression in Plants Using CRISPR-dCas9-Based Systems | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1629 | pages = 167–184 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28623586 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-7125-1_12 | isbn = 978-1-4939-7124-4 }}</ref>

Bacteria are another focus of the usage of dCas9 proteins as well. Since eukaryotes have a larger DNA makeup and genome; the much smaller bacteria are easy to manipulate. As a result, eukaryotes use dCas9 to inhibit RNA polymerase from continuing the process of transcription of genetic material.<ref name=""pmid28581505"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Horvath P | title = A decade of discovery: CRISPR functions and applications | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 7| pages = 17092 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28581505 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.92 | s2cid = 19072900 }}</ref>

=== Crystal structure ===
[[File:Cas9 5AXW.png|thumb|alt=Cas9 Structure|Crystal structure of CRISPR-associated protein Cas9, based on PDB 5AXW by Nishimasu ''et al.'']]
Cas9 features a bi-lobed architecture with the guide RNA nestled between the alpha-helical lobe (blue) and the nuclease lobe (cyan, orange, and gray). These two lobes are connected through a single bridge helix. There are two nuclease domains located in the multi-domain nuclease lobe, the RuvC (gray) which cleaves the non-target DNA strand, and the HNH nuclease domain (cyan) that cleaves the target strand of DNA. The RuvC domain is encoded by sequentially disparate sites that interact in the tertiary structure to form the RuvC cleavage domain (See right figure).

A key feature of the target DNA is that it must contain a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) consisting of the three-nucleotide sequence- NGG. This PAM is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain (PI domain, orange) located near the C-terminal end of Cas9. Cas9 undergoes distinct conformational changes between the apo, guide RNA bound, and guide RNA:DNA bound states.

This crystal structure of the DNA-bound Cas9 enzyme reveals distinct conformational changes in the alpha-helical lobe with respect to the nuclease lobe, as well as the location of the HNH domain. The protein consists of a recognition lobe (REC) and a nuclease lobe (NUC). All regions except the HNH form tight interactions with each other and sgRNA-ssDNA complex, while the HNH domain forms few contacts with the rest of the protein. In another conformation of Cas9 complex observed in the crystal, the HNH domain is not visible. These structures suggest the conformational flexibility of HNH domain.

=== Problems bacteria pose to Cas9 editing ===
Most archaea and bacteria stubbornly refuse to allow a Cas9 to edit their genome. This is because they can attach foreign DNA, that does not affect them, into their genome. Another way that these cells defy Cas9 is by process of restriction modification (RM) system. When a bacteriophage enters a bacteria or archaea cell it is targeted by the RM system. The RM system then cuts the bacteriophages DNA into separate pieces by restriction enzymes and uses endonucleases to further destroy the strands of DNA. This poses a problem to Cas9 editing because the RM system also targets the foreign genes added by the Cas9 process.<ref name=""pmid7479944"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kusano K, Naito T, Handa N, Kobayashi I | title = Restriction-modification systems as genomic parasites in competition for specific sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 24 | pages = 11095–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7479944 | pmc = 40578 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.24.11095 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...9211095K | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning ==

=== Interference of transcription by dCas9 ===
Due to the unique ability of Cas9 to bind to essentially any complement sequence in any [[genome]], researchers wanted to use this enzyme to repress [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of various genomic [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. To accomplish this, the two crucial catalytic residues of the RuvC and HNH domain can be mutated to [[alanine]] abolishing all endonuclease activity of Cas9. The resulting protein coined 'dead' Cas9 or 'dCas9' for short, can still tightly bind to dsDNA. This [[catalytic]]ally inactive Cas9 variant has been used for both mechanistic studies into Cas9 DNA interrogative binding and as a general programmable DNA binding RNA-Protein complex.

The interaction of dCas9 with target dsDNA is so tight that high [[molar concentration|molarity]] [[urea]] protein denaturant can not fully dissociate the dCas9 RNA-protein complex from dsDNA target.<ref name=""Sternberg2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternberg SH, Redding S, Jinek M, Greene EC, Doudna JA | title = DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 507 | issue = 7490 | pages = 62–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24476820 | pmc = 4106473 | doi = 10.1038/nature13011 | bibcode = 2014Natur.507...62S }}</ref> dCas9 has been targeted with engineered single guide RNAs to transcription initiation sites of any loci where dCas9 can compete with RNA polymerase at promoters to halt transcription.<ref name=""pmid23761437"" /> Also, dCas9 can be targeted to the coding region of loci such that inhibition of RNA Polymerase occurs during the elongation phase of transcription.<ref name=""pmid23761437"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bikard D, Jiang W, Samai P, Hochschild A, Zhang F, Marraffini LA | title = Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 15 | pages = 7429–37 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23761437 | pmc = 3753641 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt520 }}</ref> In Eukaryotes, silencing of gene expression can be extended by targeting dCas9 to enhancer sequences, where dCas9 can block assembly of transcription factors leading to silencing of specific gene expression.<ref name=""P23849981"" /> Moreover, the guide RNAs provided to dCas9 can be designed to include specific mismatches to its complementary cognate sequence that will quantitatively weaken the interaction of dCas9 for its programmed cognate sequence allowing a researcher to tune the extent of gene silencing applied to a gene of interest.<ref name=""pmid23761437"" />
This technology is similar in principle to [[RNAi]] such that gene expression is being modulated at the RNA level. However, the dCas9 approach has gained much traction as there exist less off-target effects and in general larger and more reproducible silencing effects through the use of dCas9 compared to RNAi screens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heintze J, Luft C, Ketteler R | title = A CRISPR CASe for high-throughput silencing | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 193 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24109485 | pmc = 3791873 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00193 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Furthermore, because the dCas9 approach to gene silencing can be quantitatively controlled, a researcher can now precisely control the extent to which a gene of interest is repressed allowing more questions about gene regulation and gene [[stoichiometry]] to be answered.

Beyond direct binding of dCas9 to transcriptionally sensitive positions of loci, dCas9 can be fused to a variety of modulatory protein domains to carry out a myriad of functions. Recently, dCas9 has been fused to [[chromatin]] remodeling proteins (HDACs/HATs) to reorganize the chromatin structure around various loci.<ref name=""pmid23761437"" /> This is important in targeting various eukaryotic genes of interest as heterochromatin structures hinder Cas9 binding. Furthermore, because Cas9 can react to [[heterochromatin]], it is theorized that this enzyme can be further applied to studying the chromatin structure of various loci.<ref name=""pmid23761437"" /> Additionally, dCas9 has been employed in genome wide screens of gene repression. By employing large libraries of guide RNAs capable of targeting thousands of genes, genome wide genetic screens using dCas9 have been conducted.<ref name=""pmid25307932"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Horlbeck MA, Adamson B, Villalta JE, Chen Y, Whitehead EH, Guimaraes C, Panning B, Ploegh HL, Bassik MC, Qi LS, Kampmann M, Weissman JS | title = Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–61 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307932 | pmc = 4253859 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029 }}</ref>

Another method for silencing transcription with Cas9 is to directly cleave mRNA products with the catalytically active Cas9 enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connell MR, Oakes BL, Sternberg SH, East-Seletsky A, Kaplan M, Doudna JA | title = Programmable RNA recognition and cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 516 | issue = 7530 | pages = 263–6 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25274302 | pmc = 4268322 | doi = 10.1038/nature13769 | bibcode = 2014Natur.516..263O }}</ref> This approach is made possible by hybridizing ssDNA with a PAM complement sequence to ssRNA allowing for a dsDNA-RNA PAM site for Cas9 binding. This technology makes available the ability to isolate endogenous RNA transcripts in cells without the need to induce chemical modifications to RNA or RNA tagging methods.

=== Transcription activation by dCas9 fusion proteins ===
In contrast to silencing genes, dCas9 can also be used to activate genes when fused to transcription activating factors.<ref name=""pmid23761437"" /> These factors include subunits of bacterial RNA Polymerase II and traditional transcription factors in eukaryotes. Recently, genome-wide screens of transcription activation have also been accomplished using dCas9 fusions named 'CRISPRa' for activation.<ref name=""pmid25307932"" />

== CRISPR/Cas9 ==
Charpentier is best known for her Nobel-winning work of deciphering the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial immune system, called [[CRISPR]]/[[Cas9]], and repurposing it into a tool for [[genome editing]]. In particular, she uncovered a novel mechanism for the maturation of a non-coding RNA which is pivotal in the function of CRISPR/Cas9. Specifically, Charpentier demonstrated that a small RNA called [[Trans-activating crRNA|tracrRNA]] is essential for the maturation of crRNA.<ref name=""Nature"">{{Cite journal|last1=Deltcheva|first1=Elitza|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sharma|first3=Cynthia M.|last4=Gonzales|first4=Karine|last5=Chao|first5=Yanjie|last6=Pirzada|first6=Zaid A.|last7=Eckert|first7=Maria R.|last8=Vogel|first8=Jörg|last9=Charpentier|first9=Emmanuelle|date=March 2011|title=CRISPR RNA maturation by trans -encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=471|issue=7340|pages=602–607|doi=10.1038/nature09886|pmid=21455174|issn=1476-4687|pmc=3070239|bibcode=2011Natur.471..602D}}</ref>

In 2011, Charpentier met [[Jennifer Doudna]] at a research conference and they began a collaboration.<ref name=""Abbott 432"" /> Working with [[Jennifer Doudna]]'s laboratory, Charpentier's laboratory showed that Cas9 could be used to make cuts in any [[DNA]] sequence desired.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://crisprtx.com/overview/ |title = CRISPR Therapeutics, About us |access-date = 15 June 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232612/http://crisprtx.com/overview/ |archive-date = 29 June 2015 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=""Science"" /> The method they developed involved the combination of Cas9 with easily created synthetic ""guide RNA"" molecules. Synthetic guide RNA is a chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA; therefore, this discovery demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be used to edit the genome with relative ease.<ref name=""Science"">{{Cite journal|last1=Jinek|first1=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=17 August 2012|title=A Programmable Dual-RNA–Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity|journal=Science|language=en|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22745249|pmc=6286148|bibcode=2012Sci...337..816J}}</ref> Researchers worldwide have employed this method successfully to edit the DNA sequences of plants, animals, and laboratory [[cell line]]s.

In 2013, Charpentier co-founded [[CRISPR Therapeutics]] and ERS Genomics along with Shaun Foy and Rodger Novak.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=15 February 2017|title=How the battle lines over CRISPR were drawn|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/how-battle-lines-over-crispr-were-drawn|access-date=10 June 2020|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en}}</ref>

Charpentier has been awarded numerous international prizes, awards, and acknowledgements, including the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], the [[Breakthrough Prize]] in [[Life Sciences]], the [[Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine]], the [[Gruber Foundation]] International Prize in Genetics, the [[Leibniz Prize]], Germany's most prestigious research prize, the [[Tang Prize]], the [[Japan Prize]], and the [[Kavli Prize]] in Nanoscience. She has won the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] jointly with [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Francisco Mojica]], whose pioneering work has ignited ""the revolution in biology permitted by CRISPR/Cas 9 techniques"". These tools facilitate genome modification with an unprecedented degree of precision, and far more cheaply and straightforwardly than any previous method. Not unlike today's simple, intuitive word processing programs, CRISPR/Cas 9 is able to ""edit"" the genome by ""cutting and pasting"" DNA sequences: a technology so efficient and powerful that it has spread like wildfire round the laboratories of the world, explains the jury, ""as a tool to understand gene function and treat disease"". Also, in 2015, [[Time 100|''Time'' magazine]] designated Charpentier one of the 100 most influential people in the world (together with Jennifer Doudna).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.umu.se/english/about-umu/news-events/news/newsdetailpage/emmanuelle-charpentier-named-in-time-magazines-100-most-influential-people-in-world-list.cid250289 |title = Emmanuelle Charpentier named in Time magazine's '100 most influential people in world' list |access-date = 15 June 2015 |date = 13 April 2015 |publisher = Umeå University }}</ref>

[[File:MEGANUCLEASE-ZFN-TALEN-CRISPR-text-to-path.svg|thumb|481x481px|The different generations of nucleases used for genome editing and the DNA repair pathways used to modify target DNA.]]'''Genome editing''', or '''genome engineering''', or '''gene editing''', is a type of [[genetic engineering]] in which [[DNA]] is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the [[genome]] of a living organism. Unlike early [[genetic engineering techniques]] that randomly inserts genetic material into a host genome, genome editing targets the insertions to site specific locations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bak|first1=Rasmus O.|last2=Gomez-Ospina|first2=Natalia|last3=Porteus|first3=Matthew H.|date=August 2018|title=Gene Editing on Center Stage|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29908711|journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=34|issue=8|pages=600–611|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.004|issn=0168-9525|pmid=29908711}}</ref>

Genome editing with engineered nucleases, i.e. all three major classes of these enzymes—zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and engineered meganucleases—were selected by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature Methods]]'' as the 2011 Method of the Year.<ref name=""pmid22312634"">{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Method of the Year 2011 | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22312634 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1852 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The CRISPR-Cas system was selected by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' as 2015 Breakthrough of the Year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/12/and-science-s-2015-breakthrough-year | title = Breakthrough of the Year: CRISPR makes the cut | author = Science News Staff | date = 17 December 2015 }}</ref>

{{as of|2015}} four families of engineered nucleases were used: [[meganuclease]]s, [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases]] (TALEN), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ([[CRISPR]]/[[Cas9]]) system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Esvelt KM, Wang HH | title = Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 641 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23340847 | pmc = 3564264 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.66 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Tan WS, Carlson DF, Walton MW, Fahrenkrug SC, Hackett PB | title = Advances in Genetics Volume 80 | chapter = Precision editing of large animal genomes | journal = Advances in Genetics | volume = 80 | pages = 37–97 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23084873 | pmc = 3683964 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-404742-6.00002-8 | isbn = 9780124047426 }}</ref><ref name=""pmid24166445"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Puchta H, Fauser F | title = Gene targeting in plants: 25 years later | journal = The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 6–8 | pages = 629–37 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24166445 | doi = 10.1387/ijdb.130194hp | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=""Boglioli_2015"">{{Cite web|url = https://www.bcgperspectives.com/Images/BCG-New-Era-Precision-Gene-Editing-10Sept15.pdf|title = Rewriting the book of life: a new era in precision genome editing|access-date = November 30, 2015|publisher = Boston Consulting Group| vauthors = Boglioli E, Richard M }}</ref> Nine genome editors were available {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Church G | title = The future of genetic codes and BRAIN codes |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2TcAA7VqmM&t=581s |website=YouTube |publisher=NIHvcast |access-date=10 February 2017 }}</ref>

In 2018, the common methods for such editing used [[Chimeric nuclease|engineered]] [[nuclease]]s, or ""molecular scissors"". These nucleases create site-specific [[double-strand breaks]] (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome. The induced double-strand breaks are [[DNA repair|repaired]] through [[Nonhomologous end joining|nonhomologous end-joining]] (NHEJ) or [[homologous recombination]] (HR), resulting in targeted [[mutation]]s ('edits').

== Background ==
[[Genetic engineering]] as method of introducing new genetic elements into organisms has been around since the 1970s. One drawback of this technology has been the random nature with which the [[DNA]] is inserted into the hosts [[genome]], which can impair or alter other genes within the organism. Although, several methods have been discovered which target the inserted genes to [[Locus (genetics)|specific sites]] within an organism genome.<ref name="":2"" /> It has also enabled the editing of specific sequences within a genome as well as reduced off target effects. This could be used for research purposes, by targeting mutations to specific genes, and in [[gene therapy]]. By inserting a functional gene into an organism and targeting it to replace the defective one it could be possible to cure certain [[genetic diseases]].

=== Gene targeting ===

==== Homologous recombination ====
Early methods to target genes to certain sites within a genome of an organism (called [[gene targeting]]) relied on [[homologous recombination]] (HR).<ref>{{cite book|title=Molecular Cell Biology|vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, Matsudaira P, Baltimore D, Darnell J|publisher=W.

Using this method on [[embryonic stem cell]]s led to the development of [[transgenic mice]] with targeted genes [[Gene knockout|knocked out]]. It has also been possible to [[Gene knock-in|knock in]] genes or alter [[gene expression]] patterns.<ref name=""pmid26397828"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rocha-Martins M, Cavalheiro GR, Matos-Rodrigues GE, Martins RA | title = From Gene Targeting to Genome Editing: Transgenic animals applications and beyond | journal = Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias | volume = 87 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 1323–48 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26397828 | doi = 10.1590/0001-3765201520140710 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In recognition of their discovery of how homologous recombination can be used to introduce genetic modifications in mice through embryonic stem cells, [[Mario Capecchi]], [[Martin Evans]] and [[Oliver Smithies]] were awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2007/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2007|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=December 15, 2008}}</ref>

==== Conditional targeting ====
If a vital gene is knocked out it can prove lethal to the organism. In order to study the function of these genes [[Site-specific recombinase technology|site specific recombinases]] (SSR) were used. The two most common types are the [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-LoxP]] and [[FLP-FRT recombination|Flp-FRT]] systems. [[Cre recombinase]] is an enzyme that removes DNA by homologous recombination between binding sequences known as Lox-P sites. The Flip-FRT system operates in a similar way, with the Flip recombinase recognising FRT sequences. By crossing an organism containing the recombinase sites flanking the gene of interest with an organism that express the SSR under control of [[Promoter (genetics)|tissue specific promoters]], it is possible to knock out or switch on genes only in certain cells. These techniques were also used to remove marker genes from transgenic animals. Further modifications of these systems allowed researchers to induce recombination only under certain conditions, allowing genes to be knocked out or expressed at desired times or [[Prenatal development|stages of development]].<ref name=""pmid26397828""/>

== Process ==

=== Double strand break repair ===
A common form of Genome editing relies on the concept of [[Double-strand breaks|DNA double stranded break]] (DSB) repair mechanics. There are two major pathways that repair DSB; [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) and [[homology directed repair]] (HDR). NHEJ uses a variety of enzymes to directly join the DNA ends while the more accurate HDR uses a homologous sequence as a template for regeneration of missing DNA sequences at the break point. This can be exploited by creating a [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] with the desired genetic elements within a sequence that is [[Sequence homology|homologous]] to the flanking sequences of a DSB. This will result in the desired change being inserted at the site of the DSB. While HDR based gene editing is similar to the homologous recombination based gene targeting, the rate of recombination is increased by at least three orders of magnitude.<ref name=""pmid8928227"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jasin M | title = Genetic manipulation of genomes with rare-cutting endonucleases | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 224–8 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8928227 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10019-6 }}</ref>

=== Engineered nucleases ===
[[File:Engineered Nucleases.jpg|thumb|400px|Groups of engineered nucleases. Matching colors signify DNA recognition patterns]]

The key to genome editing is creating a DSB at a specific point within the genome. Commonly used restriction enzymes are effective at cutting DNA, but generally recognize and cut at multiple sites. To overcome this challenge and create site-specific DSB, three distinct classes of nucleases have been discovered and bioengineered to date. These are the Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription-activator like effector nucleases ([[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]]), meganucleases and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ([[CRISPR]]/Cas9) system.

====Meganucleases====

[[Meganucleases]], discovered in the late 1980s, are enzymes in the [[endonuclease]] family which are characterized by their capacity to recognize and cut large DNA sequences (from 14 to 40 base pairs).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoddard BL | title = Homing endonuclease structure and function | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–95 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 16336743 | doi = 10.1017/s0033583505004063 | s2cid = 27841011 }}</ref> The most widespread and best known meganucleases are the [[proteins]] in the LAGLIDADG family, which owe their name to a conserved [[amino acid sequence]].

A large bank containing several tens of thousands of protein units has been created. These units can be combined to obtain chimeric meganucleases that recognize the target site, thereby providing research and development tools that meet a wide range of needs (fundamental research, health, agriculture, industry, energy, etc.) These include the industrial-scale production of two meganucleases able to cleave the human XPC gene; mutations in this gene result in ''Xeroderma pigmentosum'', a severe monogenic disorder that predisposes the patients to skin cancer and burns whenever their skin is exposed to UV rays.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Redondo P, Prieto J, Muñoz IG, Alibés A, Stricher F, Serrano L, Cabaniols JP, Daboussi F, Arnould S, Perez C, Duchateau P, Pâques F, Blanco FJ, Montoya G | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular basis of xeroderma pigmentosum group C DNA recognition by engineered meganucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 107–11 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987743 | doi = 10.1038/nature07343 | s2cid = 4300643 | bibcode = 2008Natur.456..107R }}</ref>

Meganucleases have the benefit of causing less toxicity in cells than methods such as [[Zinc finger nuclease]] (ZFN), likely because of more stringent DNA sequence recognition;<ref name=""smith"" /> however, the construction of sequence-specific enzymes for all possible sequences is costly and time-consuming, as one is not benefiting from combinatorial possibilities that methods such as ZFNs and TALEN-based fusions utilize.

==== Zinc finger nucleases ====

As opposed to meganucleases, the concept behind ZFNs and TALEN technology is based on a non-specific DNA cutting catalytic domain, which can then be linked to specific DNA sequence recognizing peptides such as zinc fingers and transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs).<ref name=""baker"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker M | title = Gene-editing nucleases | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–6 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22312637 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1807 | s2cid = 37050234 }}</ref> The first step to this was to find an endonuclease whose DNA recognition site and cleaving site were separate from each other, a situation that is not the most common among restriction enzymes.<ref name=""baker"" /> Once this enzyme was found, its cleaving portion could be separated which would be very non-specific as it would have no recognition ability. This portion could then be linked to sequence recognizing peptides that could lead to very high specificity.

[[Zinc finger]] [[structural motif|motifs]] occur in several [[transcription factors]]. The zinc ion, found in 8% of all human proteins, plays an important role in the organization of their three-dimensional structure. In transcription factors, it is most often located at the protein-DNA interaction sites, where it stabilizes the motif. The C-terminal part of each finger is responsible for the specific recognition of the DNA sequence.

The recognized sequences are short, made up of around 3 base pairs, but by combining 6 to 8 zinc fingers whose recognition sites have been characterized, it is possible to obtain specific proteins for sequences of around 20 base pairs. It is therefore possible to control the expression of a specific gene. It has been demonstrated that this strategy can be used to promote a process of angiogenesis in animals.<ref name=""pmid12415262"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rebar EJ, Huang Y, Hickey R, Nath AK, Meoli D, Nath S, Chen B, Xu L, Liang Y, Jamieson AC, Zhang L, Spratt SK, Case CC, Wolffe A, Giordano FJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Induction of angiogenesis in a mouse model using engineered transcription factors | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 1427–32 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12415262 | doi = 10.1038/nm1202-795 | s2cid = 23318821 }}</ref> It is also possible to fuse a protein constructed in this way with the catalytic domain of an endonuclease in order to induce a targeted DNA break, and therefore to use these proteins as genome engineering tools.<ref name=""pmid8577732"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YG, Cha J, Chandrasegaran S | title = Hybrid restriction enzymes: zinc finger fusions to Fok I cleavage domain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 1156–60 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8577732 | pmc = 40048 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.3.1156 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.1156K | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The method generally adopted for this involves associating two DNA binding proteins – each containing 3 to 6 specifically chosen zinc fingers – with the catalytic domain of the [[FokI]] endonuclease which need to dimerize to cleave the double-strand DNA. The two proteins recognize two DNA sequences that are a few nucleotides apart. Linking the two zinc finger proteins to their respective sequences brings the two FokI domains closer together. FokI requires dimerization to have nuclease activity and this means the specificity increases dramatically as each nuclease partner would recognize a unique DNA sequence. To enhance this effect, [[FokI|FokI nucleases]] have been engineered that can only function as heterodimers.<ref name=""nature.com"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urnov FD, Rebar EJ, Holmes MC, Zhang HS, Gregory PD | title = Genome editing with engineered zinc finger nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 636–46 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20717154 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2842 | s2cid = 205484701 }}</ref>

Several approaches are used to design specific zinc finger nucleases for the chosen sequences. The most widespread involves combining zinc-finger units with known specificities (modular assembly). Various selection techniques, using bacteria, yeast or mammal cells have been developed to identify the combinations that offer the best specificity and the best cell tolerance. Although the direct genome-wide characterization of zinc finger nuclease activity has not been reported, an assay that measures the total number of double-strand DNA breaks in cells found that only one to two such breaks occur above background in cells treated with zinc finger nucleases with a 24 bp composite recognition site and obligate heterodimer [[FokI]] nuclease domains.<ref name=""nature.com""/>

The heterodimer functioning nucleases would avoid the possibility of unwanted homodimer activity and thus increase specificity of the DSB. Although the nuclease portions of both ZFNs and TALEN constructs have similar properties, the difference between these engineered nucleases is in their DNA recognition peptide. ZFNs rely on Cys2-His2 zinc fingers and TALEN constructs on TALEs. Both of these DNA recognizing peptide domains have the characteristic that they are naturally found in combinations in their proteins. Cys2-His2 Zinc fingers typically happen in repeats that are 3 bp apart and are found in diverse combinations in a variety of nucleic acid interacting proteins such as [[transcription factors]]. Each finger of the Zinc finger domain is completely independent and the binding capacity of one finger is impacted by its neighbor. TALEs on the other hand are found in repeats with a one-to-one recognition ratio between the amino acids and the recognized nucleotide pairs. Because both zinc fingers and TALEs happen in repeated patterns, different combinations can be tried to create a wide variety of sequence specificities.<ref name=""Souza, N. 2011"" /> Zinc fingers have been more established in these terms and approaches such as modular assembly (where Zinc fingers correlated with a triplet sequence are attached in a row to cover the required sequence), OPEN (low-stringency selection of peptide domains vs. triplet nucleotides followed by high-stringency selections of peptide combination vs. the final target in bacterial systems), and bacterial one-hybrid screening of zinc finger libraries among other methods have been used to make site specific nucleases.

[[Zinc finger nucleases]] are research and development tools that have already been used to modify a range of genomes, in particular by the laboratories in the Zinc Finger Consortium. The US company [[Sangamo Therapeutics|Sangamo BioSciences]] uses zinc finger nucleases to carry out research into the genetic engineering of [[stem cells]] and the modification of [[immune cells]] for therapeutic purposes.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Reik A, etal | year = 2008 | title = Zinc finger nucleases targeting the glucocorticoid receptor allow IL-13 zetakine transgenic CTLs to kill glioblastoma cells in vivo in the presence of immunosuppressing glucocorticoids | journal = Mol.

====TALEN====
[[File:Overview of TALENs.png|thumb|General overview of the TALEN process|410px]]
[[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) are specific DNA-binding proteins that feature an array of 33 or 34-amino acid repeats. TALENs are artificial restriction enzymes designed by fusing the DNA cutting domain of a nuclease to TALE domains, which can be tailored to specifically recognize a unique DNA sequence. These fusion proteins serve as readily targetable ""DNA scissors"" for gene editing applications that enable to perform targeted genome modifications such as sequence insertion, deletion, repair and replacement in living cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaj T, Gersbach CA, Barbas CF | title = ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 397–405 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664777 | pmc = 3694601 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004 }}</ref> The DNA binding domains, which can be designed to bind any desired DNA sequence, comes from [[TAL effector]]s, DNA-binding proteins excreted by plant pathogenic ''Xanthomanos app.'' TAL effectors consists of repeated domains, each of which contains a highly conserved sequence of 34 amino acids, and recognize a single DNA nucleotide within the target site. The nuclease can create double strand breaks at the target site that can be repaired by error-prone [[Non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end-joining]] (NHEJ), resulting in gene disruptions through the introduction of small insertions or deletions. Each repeat is conserved, with the exception of the so-called repeat variable di-residues (RVDs) at amino acid positions 12 and 13. The RVDs determine the DNA sequence to which the TALE will bind. This simple one-to-one correspondence between the TALE repeats and the corresponding DNA sequence makes the process of assembling repeat arrays to recognize novel DNA sequences straightforward. These TALEs can be fused to the catalytic domain from a DNA nuclease, FokI, to generate a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). The resultant TALEN constructs combine specificity and activity, effectively generating engineered sequence-specific nucleases that bind and cleave DNA sequences only at pre-selected sites. The TALEN target recognition system is based on an easy-to-predict code. TAL nucleases are specific to their target due in part to the length of their 30+ base pairs binding site. TALEN can be performed within a 6 base pairs range of any single nucleotide in the entire genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez-Quintero AL, Rodriguez-R LM, Dereeper A, López C, Koebnik R, Szurek B, Cunnac S | title = An improved method for TAL effectors DNA-binding sites prediction reveals functional convergence in TAL repertoires of Xanthomonas oryzae strains | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e68464 | date = 2013-07-15 | pmid = 23869221 | pmc = 3711819 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0068464 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868464P | doi-access = free }}</ref>

TALEN constructs are used in a similar way to designed zinc finger nucleases, and have three advantages in targeted mutagenesis: (1) DNA binding specificity is higher, (2) [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] are lower, and (3) construction of DNA-binding domains is easier.

[[CRISPR]]s (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are genetic elements that bacteria use as a kind of [[acquired immunity]] to protect against viruses. They consist of short sequences that originate from viral genomes and have been incorporated into the bacterial genome. Cas (CRISPR associated proteins) process these sequences and cut matching viral DNA sequences. By introducing [[plasmid]]s containing Cas genes and specifically constructed CRISPRs into eukaryotic cells, the eukaryotic genome can be cut at any desired position.<ref name = MIT>{{cite web | vauthors = Young S | date = 11 February 2014 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery/ | title = Genome Surgery | work = MIT Technology Review }}</ref>

==== ARCUT ====
ARCUT stands for artificial restriction DNA cutter, it is a technique developed by Komiyama. This method uses pseudo-complementary peptide nucleic acid (pcPNA), for identifying cleavage site within the chromosome. Once pcPNA specifies the site, excision is carried out by cerium (CE) and EDTA (chemical mixture), which performs the splicing function.<ref name=""Khan 2019 pp. 326–334"">{{cite journal | last=Khan | first=Sikandar Hayat | title=Genome-Editing Technologies: Concept, Pros, and Cons of Various Genome-Editing Techniques and Bioethical Concerns for Clinical Application | journal=Molecular therapy.

== Precision and efficiency of engineered nucleases ==
Meganucleases method of gene editing is the least efficient of the methods mentioned above. Due to the nature of its DNA-binding element and the cleaving element, it is limited to recognizing one potential target every 1,000 nucleotides.<ref name=""Boglioli_2015"" /> ZFN was developed to overcome the limitations of meganuclease. The number of possible targets ZFN can recognized was increased to one in every 140 nucleotides.<ref name=""Boglioli_2015"" /> However, both methods are unpredictable because of their DNA-binding elements affecting each other. As a result, high degrees of expertise and lengthy and costly validations processes are required.

TALE nucleases being the most precise and specific method yields a higher efficiency than the previous two methods. It achieves such efficiency because the DNA-binding element consists of an array of TALE subunits, each of them having the capability of recognizing a specific DNA nucleotide chain independent from others, resulting in a higher number of target sites with high precision. New TALE nucleases take about one week and a few hundred dollars to create, with specific expertise in molecular biology and protein engineering.<ref name=""Boglioli_2015"" />

CRISPR nucleases have a slightly lower precision when compared to the TALE nucleases. This is caused by the need of having a specific nucleotide at one end in order to produce the guide RNA that CRISPR uses to repair the double-strand break it induces. It has been shown to be the quickest and cheapest method, only costing less than two hundred dollars and a few days of time.<ref name=""Boglioli_2015"" /> CRISPR also requires the least amount of expertise in molecular biology as the design lays in the guide RNA instead of the proteins. One major advantage that CRISPR has over the ZFN and TALEN methods is that it can be directed to target different DNA sequences using its ~80nt CRISPR sgRNAs, while both ZFN and TALEN methods required construction and testing of the proteins created for targeting each DNA sequence.<ref name=""Barrangou_2016"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Doudna JA | title = Applications of CRISPR technologies in research and beyond | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 933–941 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27606440 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3659 | s2cid = 21543486 }}</ref>

Because [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target activity]] of an active nuclease would have potentially dangerous consequences at the genetic and organismal levels, the precision of meganucleases, ZFNs, CRISPR, and TALEN-based fusions has been an active area of research. While variable figures have been reported, ZFNs tend to have more cytotoxicity than TALEN methods or RNA-guided nucleases, while TALEN and RNA-guided approaches tend to have the greatest efficiency and fewer off-target effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim JS | title = A guide to genome engineering with programmable nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineering (MAGE) ==
[[File:Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineering (MAGE).png|thumb|400px|Synthetic DNA is repeatedly introduced at multiple targeted areas of the chromosome and/or loci and then is replicated producing cells with/without mutations.]]
The methods for scientists and researchers wanting to study genomic diversity and all possible associated phenotypes were very slow, expensive, and inefficient. Prior to this new revolution, researchers would have to do single-gene manipulations and tweak the genome one little section at a time, observe the phenotype, and start the process over with a different single-gene manipulation.<ref name=""Gallagher_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher RR, Li Z, Lewis AO, Isaacs FJ | title = Rapid editing and evolution of bacterial genomes using libraries of synthetic DNA | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 2301–16 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25188632 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2014.082 | s2cid = 16447825 }}</ref> Therefore, researchers at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University designed the MAGE, a powerful technology that improves the process of in vivo genome editing. It allows for quick and efficient manipulations of a genome, all happening in a machine small enough to put on top of a small kitchen table. Those mutations combine with the variation that naturally occurs during cell mitosis creating billions of cellular mutations.

Chemically combined, synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a pool of oligionucleotides are introduced at targeted areas of the cell thereby creating genetic modifications. The cyclical process involves transformation of ssDNA (by [[electroporation]]) followed by outgrowth, during which bacteriophage homologous recombination proteins mediate annealing of ssDNAs to their genomic targets. Experiments targeting selective phenotypic markers are screened and identified by plating the cells on differential medias. Each cycle ultimately takes 2.5 hours to process, with additional time required to grow isogenic cultures and characterize mutations. By iteratively introducing libraries of mutagenic ssDNAs targeting multiple sites, MAGE can generate combinatorial genetic diversity in a cell population. There can be up to 50 genome edits, from single nucleotide base pairs to whole genome or gene networks simultaneously with results in a matter of days.<ref name=""Gallagher_2014""/>

MAGE experiments can be divided into three classes, characterized by varying degrees of scale and complexity: (i) many target sites, single genetic mutations; (ii) single target site, many genetic mutations; and (iii) many target sites, many genetic mutations.<ref name=""Gallagher_2014""/> An example of class three was reflected in 2009, where Church and colleagues were able to program ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' to produce five times the normal amount of lycopene, an antioxidant normally found in tomato seeds and linked to anti-cancer properties. They applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce isoprenoid lycopene. It took them about 3 days and just over $1,000 in materials. The ease, speed, and cost efficiency in which MAGE can alter genomes can transform how industries approach the manufacturing and production of important compounds in the bioengineering, bioenergy, biomedical engineering, synthetic biology, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and chemical industries.

=== Targeted gene modification in animals ===
The combination of recent discoveries in genetic engineering, particularly gene editing and the latest improvement in bovine reproduction technologies (e.g. ''in vitro'' embryo culture) allows for genome editing directly in fertilised oocytes using synthetic highly specific endonucleases.

Antiviral applications for therapies targeting human viruses such as HIV, herpes, and hepatitis B virus are under research. CRISPR can be used to target the virus or the host to disrupt genes encoding the virus cell-surface receptor proteins.<ref name=""Barrangou_2016"" /> In November 2018, [[He Jiankui]] announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, [[Lulu and Nana]], had been born a few weeks earlier. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Begley S |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies - STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}</ref>

In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five identical [[Clone (cell biology)|cloned]] gene-edited monkeys, using the same cloning technique that was used with [[Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua]] – the first ever cloned monkeys - and [[Dolly (clone)|Dolly the sheep]], and the same gene-editing [[Crispr]]-[[Cas9]] technique allegedly used by [[He Jiankui]] in creating the first ever gene-modified human babies [[Lulu and Nana]].

In the near future the new CRISPR system will also be able to eradicate diseases and conditions that humans are predisposed for. With this new technology scientists will be able to take the genes of a human sperm cell and egg, and replace the genes that activate cancer or other abnormal or unwanted defects. This will take the stress off from parents worrying about having a child and not able to live a normal life. After just one generation of this process, the entire future of the human race would never have to worry about the problems of deformities or predisposed conditions.<ref>""WHO launches global registry on human genome editing.""

== Prospects and limitations ==

In the future, an important goal of research into genome editing with engineered nucleases must be the improvement of the safety and specificity of the nucleases action.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Teboul L, Herault Y, Wells S, Qasim W, Pavlovic G | title = Variability in Genome Editing Outcomes: Challenges for Research Reproducibility and Clinical Safety | language = English | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1422–1431 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 32243835 | pmc = 7264426 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.03.015 | url = }}</ref> For example, improving the ability to detect off-target events can improve our ability to learn about ways of preventing them. In addition, zinc-fingers used in ZFNs are seldom completely specific, and some may cause a toxic reaction. However, the toxicity has been reported to be reduced by modifications done on the cleavage domain of the ZFN.<ref name=""Carroll"" />

In addition, research by [[Dana Carroll]] into modifying the genome with engineered nucleases has shown the need for better understanding of the basic recombination and repair machinery of DNA. In the future, a possible method to identify secondary targets would be to capture broken ends from cells expressing the ZFNs and to sequence the flanking DNA using high-throughput sequencing.<ref name=""Carroll"" />

Because of the ease of use and cost-efficiency of CRISPR, extensive research is currently being done on it. There are now more publications on CRISPR than ZFN and TALEN despite how recent the discovery of CRISPR is.<ref name=""Barrangou_2016"" /> Both CRISPR and TALEN are favored to be the choices to be implemented in large-scale productions due to their precision and efficiency.

Genome editing occurs also as a natural process without artificial genetic engineering. The agents that are competent to edit genetic codes are viruses or subviral RNA-agents.

Although GEEN has higher efficiency than many other methods in reverse genetics, it is still not highly efficient; in many cases less than half of the treated populations obtain the desired changes.<ref name=""pmid19404258""/> For example, when one is planning to use the cell's NHEJ to create a mutation, the cell's HDR systems will also be at work correcting the DSB with lower mutational rates.

Traditionally, mice have been the most common choice for researchers as a host of a disease model. CRISPR can help bridge the gap between this model and human clinical trials by creating transgenic disease models in larger animals such as pigs, dogs, and non-human primates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Im W, Moon J, Kim M | title = Applications of CRISPR/Cas9 for Gene Editing in Hereditary Movement Disorders | journal = Journal of Movement Disorders | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 136–43 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27667185 | pmc = 5035944 | doi = 10.14802/jmd.16029 }}</ref><ref name=""Hsu_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Lander ES, Zhang F | title = Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 1262–1278 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24906146 | pmc = 4343198 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010 }}</ref> Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the programmed Cas9 protein and the sgRNA can be directly introduced into fertilized zygotes to achieve the desired gene modifications when creating transgenic models in rodents. This allows bypassing of the usual cell targeting stage in generating transgenic lines, and as a result, it reduces generation time by 90%.<ref name=""Hsu_2014"" />

One potential that CRISPR brings with its effectiveness is the application of xenotransplantation. In previous research trials, CRISPR demonstrated the ability to target and eliminate endogenous retroviruses, which reduces the risk of transmitting diseases and reduces immune barriers.<ref name=""Barrangou_2016""/> Eliminating these problems improves donor organ function, which brings this application closer to a reality.

In plants, genome editing is seen as a viable solution to the conservation of biodiversity.

A '''guide RNA''' ('''gRNA''') is a piece of [[RNA]] that functions as a guide for RNA- or DNA-targeting [[Enzyme|enzymes]], with which it forms [[Protein–ligand complex|complexes]]. Very often these enzymes will delete, insert or otherwise alter the targeted RNA or DNA. They occur naturally, serving important functions, but can also be designed to be used for targeted editing, such as with [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR-Cas9]] and CRISPR-Cas12.

==History==
RNA-editing Guide RNA was discovered in 1990 by B. Blum, N. Bakalara, and L. Simpson<ref name=""Blum"">{{Cite journal|last1=Blum|first1=B.|last2=Bakalara|first2=N.|last3=Simpson|first3=L.|date=1990-01-26|title=A model for RNA editing in kinetoplastid mitochondria: ""guide"" RNA molecules transcribed from maxicircle DNA provide the edited information|journal=Cell|volume=60|issue=2|pages=189–198|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90735-w|issn=0092-8674|pmid=1688737|s2cid=19656609}}</ref> in the mitochondria of protists called Leishmania tarentolae. The guide RNA there is encoded in maxicircle DNA and contains sequences matching those within the edited regions of the mRNA. They enable the cleavage, insertion and deletion of bases.

==Guide RNA in Protists==
[[Trypanosomatid]] protists and other [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastids]] have a novel post-transcriptional mitochondrial RNA modification process known as ""RNA editing"". They have a large segment of highly organized DNA segments in their mitochondria. This mitochondrial DNA is circular and is divided into maxicircles and minicircles. A cell contains about 20-50 [[maxicircle]]s which have both coding and non coding regions. The coding region is highly conserved (16-17kb) and the non-coding region varies depending on the species. Minicircles are small but more numerous than maxicircles. Minicircles constitute 95% of the mass of kinetoplastid DNA. Maxicircles can encode ""[[cryptogene]]s"" and some gRNAs; minicircles can encode the majority of gRNAs. As many as 1000 gRNAs can be encoded by 250 or more minicircles. Some gRNA genes show identical insertion and deletion sites even if they have different sequences, whereas other gRNA sequences are not complementary to pre-edited mRNA. Maxicircles and minicircles molecules are catenated into a giant network of DNA that is situated at the base of the [[flagellum]] in the inner compartment of the single mitochondrion.<ref name=""Blum""/>

A majority of the maxicircle transcripts can not be translated into proteins due to multiple frameshifts in the sequences. These frameshifts are corrected after transcription by the insertion and deletion of [[uridine]] residues at precise sites which create an open reading frame that is translated into a mitochondrial protein homologous to mitochondrial proteins from other cells. The insertions and deletions are mediated by short guide RNA (gRNAs) which encode the editing information in the form of complementary sequences (allowing GU as well as GC base pairs).

=== gRNA-mRNA Complex ===
The guide RNA are mainly transcribed from the intergenic region of DNA maxicircle and these are complementary to mature mRNA. It is important for gRNA to interact initially with pre-edited mRNA and then its 5' region base pair with complementary mRNA . The 3' end of gRNA contains oligo 'U' tail (5-25 nucleotides in length) which is a non encoded region but interacts and forms a stable complex with A and G rich regions of mRNA. This initial hybrid helps in the recognition of specific mRNA site to be edited.<ref name=""Connell"">{{Cite journal|last1=Connell|first1=Gregory J.|last2=Byrne|first2=Elaine M.|last3=Simpson|first3=Larry|date=1997-02-14|title=Guide RNA-independent and Guide RNA-dependent Uridine Insertion into Cytochrome b mRNA in a Mitochondrial Lysate from Leishmania tarentolae ROLE OF RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURE|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=272|issue=7|pages=4212–4218|doi=10.1074/jbc.272.7.4212|issn=0021-9258|pmid=9020135|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Function===
The presence of two genomes in the mitochondrion, one of which contains sequence information that corrects errors in the other genome, is novel. Editing proceeds generally 3' to 5' on the mRNA. The initial editing event occurs when a gRNA forms an RNA duplex with a complementary mRNA sequence just downstream of the editing site. This then recruits a number of [[ribonucleoprotein]] complexes that direct the cleavage of the first mismatched base adjacent to the gRNA-mRNA anchor. [[Uridylyltransferase]] inserts 'U' at 3' terminal and RNA ligase is responsible for joining two cut ends. The adjacent upstream editing site is then modified in the same manner. A single gRNA usually encodes the information for several editing sites (an editing ""block""), the editing of which produces a complete gRNA/mRNA duplex. This process of modification is termed as original enzyme cascade model.<ref name=""Connell""/>

In the case of ""pan-edited"" mRNAs,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maslov|first=Dmitri A.|date=October 2010|title=Complete set of mitochondrial pan-edited mRNAs in Leishmania mexicana amazonensis LV78|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|volume=173|issue=2|pages=107–114|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.05.013|issn=0166-6851|pmc=2913609|pmid=20546801}}</ref> the duplex unwinds and another gRNA then forms a duplex with the edited mRNA sequence and initiates another round of editing. The overlapping gRNAs form an editing ""domain"". In some genes there are multiple editing domains. The extent of editing for any particular gene varies between trypanosomatid species. The variation consists of the loss of editing at the 3' side, probably due to the loss of minicircle sequence classes that encode specific gRNAs. A [[retroposition]] model has been proposed to account for the partial, and in some cases, complete, loss of editing in evolution. Loss of editing is lethal in most cases, although losses have been seen in old laboratory strains. The maintenance of editing over the long evolutionary history of these ancient protists suggests the presence of a selective advantage, the exact nature of which is still uncertain.

It is not clear why trypanosomatids utilize such an elaborate mechanism to produce mRNAs. It may have originated in the early mitochondria of the ancestor of the kintoplastid protist lineage, since it is present in the [[Bodonida|bodonids]] which are ancestral to the trypanosomatids, and may not be present in the [[euglenoid]]s, which branched from the same common ancestor as the kinetoplastids.

In the protozoan ''Leishmania tarentolae'', 12 of the 18 mitochondrial genes are edited using this process. One such gene is Cyb. The mRNA is actually edited twice in succession. For the first edit, the relevant sequence on the mRNA is as follows:
 mRNA 5' AAAGAAAAGGCUUUAACUUCAGGUUGU 3'
The 3' end is used to anchor the gRNA (gCyb-I gRNA in this case) by basepairing (some G/U pairs are used). The 5' end does not exactly match and one of three specific [[endonuclease]]s cleaves the mRNA at the mismatch site.
 gRNA 3' AAUAAUAAAUUUUUAAAUAUAAUAGAAAAUUGAAGUUCAGUA 5'
 mRNA 5'   A  A   AGAAA   A G  G C UUUAACUUCAGGUUGU 3'
The mRNA is now ""repaired"" by adding U's at each editing site in succession, giving the following sequence:
 gRNA 3' AAUAAUAAAUUUUUAAAUAUAAUAGAAAAUUGAAGUUCAGUA 5'
 mRNA 5' UUAUUAUUUAGAAAUUUAUGUUGUCUUUUAACUUCAGGUUGU 3'
This particular gene has two overlapping gRNA editing sites. The 5' end of this section is the 3' anchor for another gRNA (gCyb-II gRNA)

==Guide RNA in Prokaryotes==
===CRISPR In Prokaryotes===
[[File:Schematic Structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-DNA Ternary Complex.svg|thumb|519x519px]]
The majority of prokaryotes, which encompass bacteria and archaea, use [[CRISPR]] (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) with its associated Cas enzymes, as their adaptive immune system. When prokaryotes are infected by phages, and manage to fend off the attack, specific Cas enzymes will cut the phage DNA (or RNA) and integrate the parts in between the repeats of the CRISPR sequence. The stored segments can then be recognized in future virus attacks and Cas enzymes will use RNA copies of them, together with their associated CRISPR segments, as gRNA to identify the foreign sequences and render them harmless.

===Structure===
Guide RNA targets the complementary sequences by simple Watson-Crick base pairing. In type II CRISPR/cas system, single guide RNA directs the target specific regions. Single guide RNA are artificially programmed combination of two RNA molecules, one component [[Trans-activating crRNA|(tracrRNA]]) is responsible for Cas9 endonuclease activity and other (crRNA) binds to the target specific DNA region. Therefore, the trans activating RNA ([[Trans-activating crRNA|tracrRNA]]) and crRNA are two key components and are joined by tetraloop which results in formation of sgRNA. TracrRNA are base pairs having a [[Stem-loop|stem loop]] structure in itself and attaches to the [[endonuclease]] enzyme. Transcription of CRISPR locus gives CRISPR RNA (crRNA) which have spacer flanked region due to repeat sequences, consisting of 18-20 base pair. crRNA identifies the specific complementary target region which is cleaved by Cas9 after its binding with crRNA and tcRNA, which all together known as effector complex. With the modifications in the crRNA sequences of the guide RNA, the binding location can be changed and hence defining it as a user defined program.


==Applications==
===Designing gRNAs===
The targeting specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 is determined by the 20-nt sequence at the 5' end of the gRNA. The desired target sequence must precede the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) which is a short DNA sequence usually 2-6 base pairs in length that follows the DNA region targeted for cleavage by the CRISPR system, such as CRISPR-Cas9. The PAM is required for a Cas nuclease to cut and is generally found 3-4 nucleotides downstream from the cut site. After base pairing of the gRNA to the target, Cas9 mediates a double strand break about 3-nt upstream of PAM.

The GC content of the guide sequence should be 40-80%. High GC content stabilizes the RNA-DNA duplex while destabilizing off-target hybridization. The length of the guide sequence should be between 17-24bp noting a shorter sequence minimizes off-target effects. Guide sequences less than 17bp have a chance of targeting multiple loci.

===CRISPR Cas9===
[[File:GRNA-Cas9-colourfriendly.png|thumb|457x457px]]
CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 is a technique used for gene editing and gene therapy. Cas is an endonuclease enzyme that cuts the DNA at a specific location directed by a guide RNA. This is a target-specific technique that can introduce gene knock out or knock in depending on the double strand repair pathway. Evidence shows that both in-vitro and in-vivo required  tracrRNA for Cas9 and target DNA sequence binding. The CRISPR CAS9 system consists of three main stages. The first stage is extension of bases in the CRISPR locus region by addition of foreign DNA spacers in the genome sequence. Several different proteins, like cas1 and cas2, help in finding new spacers. The next stage involves transcription of CRISPR: pre-crRNA (precursor CRISPR RNA) are expressed by the transcription of CRISPR repeat-spacer array. On further modification in the pre-crRNA, they are converted to single spacer flanked regions forming short crRNA. RNA maturation process is similar in type I and II but different in type III, aRNA as tracers are added in this step. The third stage involves binding of cas9 protein and directing it to cleave the DNA segment. The Cas9 protein binds to a combined form of crRNA and tracrRNA forming an effector complex. This act as guide RNA for cas9 protein directing it for its endonuclease activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Karvelis|first1=Tautvydas|last2=Gasiunas|first2=Giedrius|last3=Miksys|first3=Algirdas|last4=Barrangou|first4=Rodolphe|last5=Horvath|first5=Philippe|last6=Siksnys|first6=Virginijus|date=2013-05-01|title=crRNA and tracrRNA guide Cas9-mediated DNA interference in Streptococcus thermophilus|journal=RNA Biology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=841–851|doi=10.4161/rna.24203|issn=1547-6286|pmc=3737341|pmid=23535272}}</ref>


===RNA mutagenesis===
One important gene regulation method is RNA mutagenesis which can be introduced by RNA editing with the help of gRNA. Guide RNA replaces adenosine with inosine at the specific target site and modify the genetic code.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fukuda|first1=Masatora|last2=Umeno|first2=Hiromitsu|last3=Nose|first3=Kanako|last4=Nishitarumizu|first4=Azusa|last5=Noguchi|first5=Ryoma|last6=Nakagawa|first6=Hiroyuki|date=2017-02-02|title=Construction of a guide-RNA for site-directed RNA mutagenesis utilising intracellular A-to-I RNA editing|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|pages=41478|doi=10.1038/srep41478|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5288656|pmid=28148949|bibcode=2017NatSR...741478F}}</ref> Adenosine deaminase acts on RNA bringing post transcriptional modification by altering the codons and different protein functions. Guide RNAs are the small nucleolar RNA, these along with riboproteins perform intracellular RNA alterations such as ribomethylation in rRNA and introduction of pseudouridine in preribosomal RNA. Guide RNAs binds to the anti sense RNA sequence and regulates the RNA modification. It is observed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA) are generally used as target RNA sequence and modifications are comparatively easy to introduce because of small size.

'''Francisco Juan Martínez Mojica'''{{efn Spanish name|Martínez|Mojica}} (born 5 October 1963) is a Spanish [[molecular biologist]] and [[microbiologist]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in [[Spain]]. He is known for his discovery of repetitive, functional [[DNA sequence]]s in [[bacteria]] which he named [[CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). These were later developed into the first widespread [[genome editing]] tool, [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR-Cas9]].{{r|ledford}}

== Early life and education ==
Mojica was born in [[Elche]], Spain, on 5 October 1963. He attended Los Andes elementary school, Vázquez de Mella school, and Instituto Carrus high school. He enrolled first at the [[University of Murcia]] to study biology and later moved to the [[University of Valencia]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1986) and [[University of Alicante]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1993). During his doctoral studies, he visited [[Paris-Sud University]]. He then received post-doctoral training at the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Since 1994, Mojica has been a faculty member at the [[University of Alicante]], were he has focused on [[molecular microbiology]], which led to his discovery of the CRISPR system.

== Career and research ==

===The discovery of CRISPR===
Mojica was the first researcher to characterize what is now called a CRISPR locus, reported in 1993. Part of the sequence was reported previously by [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] in 1987. Mojica described the complete gene sequence repeats in the archaeal organisms ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and studied their function.<ref name=""Mojica Juez Rodriguez-Valera 1993 pp. 613–621"">{{cite journal | last1=Mojica | first1=F.

He coined the term CRISPR through correspondence with Ruud Jansen of [[Utrecht University]], proposing the acronym of ''Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats'' to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in scientific literature.

===CRISPR as a microbial immune system===
In 2003, Mojica wrote the first paper suggesting that CRISPR was an innate microbial immune system. The paper was rejected by a series of high-profile journals, including ''Nature'', ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', ''Molecular Microbiology'' and ''Nucleic Acid Research'', before finally being accepted by ''Journal of Molecular Evolution'' in February, 2005.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mojica |first1=Francisco J.

A '''designer baby''' is a baby whose [[genetics|genetic makeup]] has been selected or altered, often to include a particular [[gene]] or to remove genes associated with disease.<ref>Veit, W. (2018). Procreative Beneficence and Genetic Enhancement – KRITERION – Journal of Philosophy 32(1):75-92. https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11026.89289</ref> This process usually involves analysing a wide range of human [[embryos]] to identify genes associated with particular [[disease]]s and characteristics, and selecting embryos that have the desired genetic makeup; a process known as [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]. Other potential methods by which a baby's genetic information can be altered involve directly [[genome editing|editing the genome]] before birth. This process is not routinely performed and only one instance of this is known to have occurred as of 2019, where Chinese twins [[Lulu and Nana]] were edited as embryos, causing widespread criticism.<ref name = ""BMJLuluNanaCriticism"">{{cite news | vauthors = Dyer O  |title= Researcher who edited babies' genome retreats from view as criticism mounts |url= https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5113 |work=BMJ |date=30 November 2018 |pages=k5113 |language=en |doi=10.1136/bmj.k5113}}</ref>

Genetically altered embryos can be achieved by introducing the desired genetic material into the embryo itself, or into the [[sperm]] and/or [[oocyte|egg]] cells of the parents; either by [[gene therapy|delivering the desired genes directly into the cell]] or using the gene-editing technology. This process is known as [[human germline engineering|germline engineering]] and performing this on embryos that will be brought to term is not typically permitted by law.<ref name=""Med&Law"">{{cite book | vauthors = Kannan K |title=Medicine and the law |date=2014 |isbn=9780198082880 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198082880.001.0001 }}</ref> Editing embryos in this manner means that the genetic changes can be [[heritable|carried down to future generations]], and since the technology concerns editing the genes of an unborn baby, it is considered controversial and is subject to ethical debate.<ref name = ""IVF to immortality"">{{cite book |title=From IVF to immortality : controversy in the era of reproductive technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199219780|date=2008-02-03 }}</ref> While some scientists condone the use of this technology to treat disease, some have raised concerns that this could be translated into using the technology for cosmetic means and [[human enhancement|enhancement of human traits]], with implications for the wider society.<ref name=""Guardianethics1"" />

==Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis==
{{Main|Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis}}

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is a procedure in which embryos are screened prior to [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. The technique is used alongside [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] (IVF) to obtain embryos for evaluation of the genome – alternatively, ovocytes can be screened prior to [[fertilisation]]. The technique was first used in 1989.<ref name=""handyside1990"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Handyside AH, Kontogianni EH, Hardy K, Winston RM | title = Pregnancies from biopsied human preimplantation embryos sexed by Y-specific DNA amplification | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268 | pages = 768–770 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 2330030 | doi = 10.1038/344768a0 | s2cid = 4326607 | bibcode = 1990Natur.344..768H }}</ref>
 
PGD is used primarily to select embryos for implantation in the case of possible [[Birth defect|genetic defects]], allowing identification of [[mutation|mutated]] or disease-related [[alleles]] and selection against them. It is especially useful in embryos from parents where one or both carry a [[genetic disorder|heritable disease]]. PGD can also be used to select for embryos of a certain sex, most commonly when a disease is more strongly associated with one sex than the other (as is the case for [[sex linkage|X-linked disorders]] which are more common in males, such as [[haemophilia]]). Infants born with traits selected following PGD are sometimes considered to be designer babies.<ref name=""PGD Ethnography"">{{cite book | vauthors = Franklin S, Roberts C |title=Born and Made: An Ethnography of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis. |date=2006 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691121932 |url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8313.html}}</ref>

One application of PGD is the selection of ‘[[saviour siblings]]’, children who are born to provide a [[organ transplant|transplant]] (of an organ or group of cells) to a sibling with a usually life-threatening disease. Saviour siblings are conceived through IVF and then screened using PGD to analyze genetic similarity to the child needing a transplant, to reduce the risk of [[transplant rejection|rejection]].<ref name=""savioursibs"">{{cite web |title=Embryo and the Law: Saviour Siblings |url=https://embryo-ethics.smd.qmul.ac.uk/tutorials/embryo-and-the-law/saviour-siblings/ |website=Embryo ethics}}</ref>

===Process===
[[File:PGD process.png|400px|thumb|Process of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. ''In vitro'' fertilisation involves either incubation of sperm and oocyte together, or injection of sperm directly into the oocyte. PCR - polymerase chain reaction, FISH - fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridisation.]]
Embryos for PGD are obtained from IVF procedures in which the oocyte is artificially fertilised by sperm. Oocytes from the woman are harvested following [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] (COH), which involves fertility treatments to induce production of multiple oocytes. After harvesting the oocytes, they are fertilised ''[[in vitro]]'', either during incubation with multiple sperm cells in culture, or ''via'' [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), where sperm is directly injected into the oocyte. The resulting embryos are usually cultured for 3–6 days, allowing them to reach the [[blastomere]] or [[blastocyst]] stage.<ref name=""Sermon2004"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sermon K, Van Steirteghem A, Liebaers I | title = Preimplantation genetic diagnosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9421 | pages = 1633–1641 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15145639 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16209-0 | s2cid = 22797985 }}</ref>

Once embryos reach the desired stage of development, cells are biopsied and genetically screened. The screening procedure varies based on the nature of the disorder being investigated.

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a process in which [[DNA]] sequences are amplified to produce many more copies of the same segment, allowing screening of large samples and identification of specific genes.<ref name=""PCR2013"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garibyan L, Avashia N | title = Polymerase chain reaction | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23399825 | pmc = 4102308 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2013.1 }}</ref> The process is often used when screening for [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|monogenic disorders]], such as [[cystic fibrosis]].

Another screening technique, [[fluorescent in situ hybridisation|fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridisation]] (FISH) uses fluorescent probes which specifically bind to highly [[Complementarity (molecular biology)#DNA and RNA base pair complementarity|complementary sequences]] on [[chromosomes]], which can then be identified using [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]].<ref name=""FISH2010"">{{cite journal| vauthors = Bishop R |title=Applications of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detecting genetic aberrations of medical significance|journal=Bioscience Horizons|volume=3|issue=1|year=2010|pages=85–95|issn=1754-7431|doi=10.1093/biohorizons/hzq009|doi-access=free}}</ref> FISH is often used when screening for chromosomal abnormalities such as [[aneuploidy]], making it a useful tool when screening for disorders such as [[Down syndrome]].

Following the screening, embryos with the desired trait (or lacking an undesired trait such as a mutation) are transferred into the mother's [[uterus]], then allowed to [[embryonic development|develop naturally]].

===Regulation===

PGD regulation is determined by individual countries’ governments, with some prohibiting its use entirely, including in [[Austria]], [[China]], and [[Ireland]].<ref name=""PGDtreatment"">{{cite web |title=Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) |url=https://fertility.treatmentabroad.com/tests-and-investigations/preimplantation-genetic-diagnosis-pgd |website=Fertility treatment abroad |publisher=LaingBuisson International Limited}}</ref>

In many countries, PGD is permitted under very stringent conditions for medical use only, as is the case in [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=""Bayefsky2016"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayefsky MJ | title = Comparative preimplantation genetic diagnosis policy in Europe and the USA and its implications for reproductive tourism | journal = Reproductive Biomedicine & Society Online | volume = 3 | pages = 41–47 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 28959787 | pmc = 5612618 | doi = 10.1016/j.rbms.2017.01.001 }}</ref><ref name=""GianaroliCrivello2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gianaroli L, Crivello AM, Stanghellini I, Ferraretti AP, Tabanelli C, Magli MC | title = Reiterative changes in the Italian regulation on IVF: the effect on PGD patients' reproductive decisions | journal = Reproductive Biomedicine Online | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–132 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24268726 | doi = 10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.08.014 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Whilst PGD in Italy and Switzerland is only permitted under certain circumstances, there is no clear set of specifications under which PGD can be carried out, and selection of embryos based on sex is not permitted.

==Human germline engineering==
{{Main|Human germline engineering}}
Human germline engineering is a process in which the human genome is edited within a [[germ cell]], such as a sperm cell or oocyte (causing heritable changes), or in the [[zygote]] or embryo following fertilization.<ref name=""germline eng book"">{{cite book | vauthors = Stock G, Campbell J |title=Editing the Human Germline |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/BioMed/Engineering%20the%20Human%20Germline%20-%20G.%20Stock%2C%20J.%20Campbell%20%28Oxford%2C%202000%29%20WW.pdf }}</ref> Germline engineering results in changes in the genome being incorporated into every cell in the body of the offspring (or of the individual following embryonic germline engineering). This process differs from [[somatic cell]] engineering, which does not result in heritable changes. Most human germline editing is performed on individual cells and non-viable embryos, which are destroyed at a very early stage of development. In November 2018, however, a Chinese scientist, [[He Jiankui]], announced that he had created the first human germline genetically edited babies.<ref name=""GuardianJiankui1"">{{cite news |title=World's first gene-edited babies created in China, claims scientist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/26/worlds-first-gene-edited-babies-created-in-china-claims-scientist |agency=The Guardian |date=26 Nov 2018}}</ref>

Genetic engineering relies on a knowledge of human genetic information, made possible by research such as the [[Human Genome Project]], which identified the position and function of all the genes in the human genome.<ref name=""HGP"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hood L, Rowen L | title = The Human Genome Project: big science transforms biology and medicine | journal = Genome Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 79 | date = 13 Sep 2013 | pmid = 24040834 | pmc = 4066586 | doi = 10.1186/gm483 }}</ref> As of 2019, [[high-throughput sequencing]] methods allow [[genome sequencing]] to be conducted very rapidly, making the technology widely available to researchers.<ref name=""nextgenseq"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Straiton J, Free T, Sawyer A, Martin J | title = From Sanger sequencing to genome databases and beyond | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 60–63 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30744413 | doi = 10.2144/btn-2019-0011 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Germline modification is typically accomplished through techniques which incorporate a new gene into the genome of the embryo or germ cell in a specific location. This can be achieved by introducing the desired DNA directly to the cell for it to be incorporated, or by replacing a gene with one of interest. These techniques can also be used to remove or disrupt unwanted genes, such as ones containing mutated sequences.

Whilst germline engineering has mostly been performed in [[mammals]] and other animals, research on human cells ''in vitro'' is becoming more common. Most commonly used in human cells are [[germline gene therapy]] and the engineered nuclease system [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR/Cas9]].
 
===Germline gene modification===
[[Gene therapy]] is the delivery of a [[nucleic acid]] (usually DNA or [[RNA]]) into a cell as a pharmaceutical agent to treat disease.<ref name=""genetherapyNIH"">{{cite web |title=What is gene therapy? |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/genetherapy |website=NIH: U.S. National Library of Medicine}}</ref> Most commonly it is carried out using a [[vectors in gene therapy|vector]], which transports the nucleic acid (usually DNA encoding a therapeutic gene) into the target cell. A vector can [[transduction (genetics)|transduce]] a desired copy of a gene into a specific location to be [[gene expression|expressed]] as required. Alternatively, a [[transgene]] can be inserted to deliberately disrupt an unwanted or mutated gene, preventing [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] of the faulty gene products to avoid a disease [[phenotype]].

Gene therapy in patients is typically carried out on somatic cells in order to treat conditions such as some [[leukaemias]] and [[vascular diseases]].<ref name=""Leukaemia1"">{{cite journal| vauthors = Ledford H |title=Cell therapy fights leukaemia|journal=Nature|year=2011|issn=1476-4687|doi=10.1038/news.2011.472}}</ref><ref name=""Leukaemia2"">{{cite news | vauthors = Coghlan A |title=Gene therapy cures leukaemia in eight days |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729104-100-gene-therapy-cures-leukaemia-in-eight-days/ |agency=New Scientist |date=26 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=""genetherapyPAD"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimamura M, Nakagami H, Taniyama Y, Morishita R | title = Gene therapy for peripheral arterial disease | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 1175–1184 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24766232 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2014.912272 | s2cid = 24820913 }}</ref>

Gene transfer to cells is usually by vector delivery. Vectors are typically divided into two classes – [[viral vectors|viral]] and [[vectors in gene therapy#Non-viral methods|non-viral]].

====Viral vectors====

[[Viruses]] infect cells by transducing their genetic material into a host's cell, using the host's cellular machinery to generate viral proteins needed for replication and proliferation. By modifying viruses and loading them with the therapeutic DNA or RNA of interest, it is possible to use these as a vector to provide delivery of the desired gene into the cell.<ref name=""viralvectors"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins PD, Ghivizzani SC | title = Viral vectors for gene therapy | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–47 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9804053 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7258(98)00020-5 }}</ref>

[[Retroviruses]] are some of the most commonly used viral vectors, as they not only introduce their genetic material into the host cell, but also copy it into the host's genome. In the context of gene therapy, this allows permanent integration of the gene of interest into the patient's own DNA, providing longer lasting effects.<ref name=""retroviral vectors"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barquinero J, Eixarch H, Pérez-Melgosa M | title = Retroviral vectors: new applications for an old tool | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 11 | issue = S1 | pages = S3–S9 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15454951 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302363 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Viral vectors work efficiently and are mostly safe but present with some complications, contributing to the stringency of regulation on gene therapy. Despite partial inactivation of viral vectors in gene therapy research, they can still be [[immunogenic]] and elicit an [[immune response]]. This can impede viral delivery of the gene of interest, as well as cause complications for the patient themselves when used clinically, especially in those already suffering from a serious genetic illness.<ref name=""JesseGelsinger"">{{cite news | vauthors = Stolberg SG |title=The Biotech Death of Jesse Gelsinger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/magazine/the-biotech-death-of-jesse-gelsinger.html |work=The New York Times |date=28 Nov 1999}}</ref> Another difficulty is the possibility that some viruses will randomly integrate their nucleic acids into the genome, which can interrupt gene function and generate new mutations.<ref name=""RandomIntegration"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bushman FD | title = Retroviral integration and human gene therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 117 | issue = 8 | pages = 2083–2086 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17671645 | pmc = 1934602 | doi = 10.1172/JCI32949 }}</ref>
This is a significant concern when considering germline gene therapy, due to the potential to generate new mutations in the embryo or offspring.

====Non-viral vectors====

Non-viral methods of nucleic acid [[transfection]] involved injecting a naked DNA [[plasmid]] into cell for incorporation into the genome.<ref name=""nonviralvectors"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramamoorth M, Narvekar A | title = Non viral vectors in gene therapy- an overview | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = GE01–GE06 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25738007 | pmc = 4347098 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2015/10443.5394 }}</ref> This method used to be relatively ineffective with low frequency of integration, however, efficiency has since greatly improved, using methods to enhance the delivery of the gene of interest into cells. Furthermore, non-viral vectors are simple to produce on a large scale and are not highly immunogenic.

Some non-viral methods are detailed below:

*[[Electroporation]] is a technique in which high voltage pulses are used to carry DNA into the target cell across the [[cell membrane|membrane]]. The method is believed to function due to the formation of pores across the membrane, but although these are temporary, electroporation results in a high rate of [[cell death]] which has limited its use.<ref name=""electroporation"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambricht L, Lopes A, Kos S, Sersa G, Préat V, Vandermeulen G | title = Clinical potential of electroporation for gene therapy and DNA vaccine delivery | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 295–310 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26578324 | doi = 10.1517/17425247.2016.1121990 | s2cid = 207490403 }}</ref> An improved version of this technology, electron-avalanche transfection, has since been developed, which involves shorter (microsecond) high voltage pulses which result in more effective DNA integration and less cellular damage.<ref name=""electronavalanche"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalberg TW, Vankov A, Molnar FE, Butterwick AF, Huie P, Calos MP, Palanker DV | title = Gene transfer to rabbit retina with electron avalanche transfection | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 4083–4090 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936128 | doi = 10.1167/iovs.06-0092 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
*The [[gene gun]] is a physical method of DNA transfection, where a DNA plasmid is loaded onto a particle of [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] (usually [[gold]]) and loaded onto the ‘gun’.<ref name=""genegun"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida A, Nagata T, Uchijima M, Higashi T, Koide Y | title = Advantage of gene gun-mediated over intramuscular inoculation of plasmid DNA vaccine in reproducible induction of specific immune responses | journal = Vaccine | volume = 18 | issue = 17 | pages = 1725–1729 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10699319 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(99)00432-6 }}</ref> The device generates a force to penetrate the cell membrane, allowing the DNA to enter whilst retaining the metal particle.
*[[Oligonucleotides]] are used as chemical vectors for gene therapy, often used to disrupt mutated DNA sequences to prevent their expression.<ref name=""oligogenetherapy"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein CA, Castanotto D | title = FDA-Approved Oligonucleotide Therapies in 2017 | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1069–1075 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28366767 | pmc = 5417833 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.03.023 }}</ref> Disruption in this way can be achieved by introduction of small RNA molecules, called [[siRNA]], which signal cellular machinery to cleave the unwanted [[mRNA]] sequences to prevent their transcription. Another method utilises double-stranded oligonucleotides, which bind [[transcription factors]] required for transcription of the target gene. By competitively binding these transcription factors, the oligonucleotides can prevent the gene's expression.

=== ZFNs ===
{{Main|Zinc finger nuclease}}

[[Zinc finger nuclease|Zinc-finger nucleases]] (ZFNs) are enzymes generated by fusing a zinc finger DNA-binding domain to a DNA-cleavage domain. Zinc finger recognizes between 9 and 18 bases of sequence. Thus by mixing those modules, it becomes easier to target any sequence researchers wish to alter ideally within complex genomes. A ZFN is a [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] complex formed by monomers in which each subunit contains a zinc domain and a [[FokI|FokI endonuclease domain.]] The FokI domains must dimerize for activities, thus narrowing target area by ensuring that two close DNA-binding events occurs.<ref name="":0"" />

The resulting cleavage event enables most genome-editing technologies to work. After a break is created, the cell seeks to repair it.

* A method is [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ]], in which the cell polishes the two ends of broken DNA and seals them back together, often producing a frame shift.
* An alternative method is [[Homology directed repair|homology-directed]] repairs. The cell tries to fix the damage by using a copy of the sequence as a backup. By supplying their own template, researcher can have the system to insert a desired sequence instead.<ref name="":0"" />

The success of using ZFNs in gene therapy depends on the insertion of genes to the chromosomal target area without causing damage to the cell. Custom ZFNs offer an option in human cells for gene correction.

=== TALENs ===
{{Main|Transcription activator-like effector nuclease}}
There is a method called [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] that targets singular nucleotides. TALENs stand for transcription activator-like effector nucleases. TALENs are made by [[TAL effector|TAL effector DNA-binding domain]] to a DNA cleavage domain. All these methods work by as the TALENs are arranged. TALENs are “built from arrays of 33-35 amino acid modules…by assembling those arrays…researchers can target any sequence they like”.<ref name="":0"">{{cite web | vauthors = Perkel JM |title=Genome Editing with CRISPRs, TALENs and ZFNs |url=https://www.biocompare.com/editorial-articles/144186-genome-editing-with-crisprs-talens-and-zfns/ |website=Biocompare |publisher=Biocompare}}</ref> This event is referred as Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD). The relationship between the amino acids enables researchers to engineer a specific DNA domain. The TALEN enzymes are designed to remove specific parts of the DNA strands and replace the section; which enables edits to be made. TALENs can be used to edit genomes using [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) and [[homology directed repair]].

===CRISPR/Cas9===
{{Main|CRISPR gene editing}}
[[File:GRNA-Cas9-colourfriendly.png|thumb|CRISPR-Cas9. PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) is required for target binding.]]
The CRISPR/Cas9 system ([[CRISPR]] – Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, [[Cas9]] – CRISPR-associated protein 9) is a genome editing technology based on the [[bacterial]] antiviral CRISPR/Cas system. The bacterial system has evolved to recognize viral nucleic acid sequences and cut these sequences upon recognition, damaging infecting viruses. The gene editing technology uses a simplified version of this process, manipulating the components of the bacterial system to allow location-specific gene editing.<ref name=""CRISPR NIH"">{{cite web |title=What are genome editing and CRISPR/Cas9? |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting |website=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=NIH}}</ref>

The CRISPR/Cas9 system broadly consists of two major components – the Cas9 [[nuclease]] and a [[guide RNA]] (gRNA). The gRNA contains a Cas-binding sequence and a ~20 [[nucleotide]] spacer sequence, which is specific and complementary to the target sequence on the DNA of interest. Editing specificity can therefore be changed by modifying this spacer sequence.<ref name=""CRISPR NIH"" />

[[File:DNA Repair-colourfriendly.png|thumb|upright=1.3|DNA repair after double-strand break]]
Upon system delivery to a cell, Cas9 and the gRNA bind, forming a [[Nucleoprotein#Ribonucleoproteins|ribonucleoprotein]] complex. This causes a [[conformational change]] in Cas9, allowing it to cleave DNA if the gRNA spacer sequence binds with sufficient [[sequence homology#Identity, similarity, and conservation|homology]] to a particular sequence in the host genome.<ref name=""Addgene CRISPR"">{{cite web |title=CRISPR Guide |url=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/ |website=AddGene}}</ref> When the gRNA binds to the target sequence, Cas will cleave the [[locus (genetics)|locus]], causing a [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double-strand break]] (DSB).

The resulting DSB can be [[DNA repair|repaired]] by one of two mechanisms –

*[[Non-homologous end joining|Non-Homologous End Joining]] (NHEJ) - an efficient but error-prone mechanism, which often introduces insertions and deletions ([[indels]]) at the DSB site. This means it is often used in [[gene knockout|knockout]] experiments to disrupt genes and introduce loss of function mutations.
*[[Homology directed repair|Homology Directed Repair]] (HDR) - a less efficient but high-fidelity process which is used to introduce precise modifications into the target sequence. The process requires adding a DNA repair template including a desired sequence, which the cell's machinery uses to repair the DSB, incorporating the sequence of interest into the genome.

Since NHEJ is more efficient than HDR, most DSBs will be repaired ''via'' NHEJ, introducing gene knockouts. To increase frequency of HDR, inhibiting genes associated with NHEJ and performing the process in particular [[cell cycle]] phases (primarily [[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]]) appear effective.

CRISPR/Cas9 is an effective way of manipulating the genome ''[[in vivo]]'' in animals as well as in human cells ''in vitro'', but some issues with the efficiency of delivery and editing mean that it is not considered safe for use in viable human embryos or the body's germ cells. As well as the higher efficiency of NHEJ making inadvertent knockouts likely, CRISPR can introduce DSBs to unintended parts of the genome, called off-target effects.<ref name=""offtarget CRISPR"">{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Keep off-target effects in focus | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1081 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082857 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-018-0150-3 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These arise due to the spacer sequence of the gRNA conferring sufficient sequence homology to random loci in the genome, which can introduce random mutations throughout.

====Regulation on CRISPR use====

In 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing was held in [[Washington D.C.]], hosted by scientists from China, the UK and the U.S.. The summit concluded that genome editing of somatic cells using CRISPR and other genome editing tools would be allowed to proceed under [[FDA]] regulations, but human germline engineering would not be pursued.<ref name=""FDA gene therapy"" />

In February 2016, scientists at the [[Francis Crick Institute]] in [[London]] were given a license permitting them to edit human embryos using CRISPR to investigate early development.<ref name = ""NatureCrickCRISPR"">{{cite news | vauthors = Callaway E |title=UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos |url=https://www.nature.com/news/uk-scientists-gain-licence-to-edit-genes-in-human-embryos-1.19270 |publisher=Nature |date=1 Feb 2016}}</ref> Regulations were imposed to prevent the researchers from implanting the embryos and to ensure experiments were stopped and embryos destroyed after seven days.

==Lulu and Nana controversy==
{{Main|He Jiankui affair}}

[[File:He Jiankui at Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing (cropped).jpg|thumb|He Jiankui speaking at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, November 2018]]
The Lulu and Nana controversy refers to the two Chinese twin girls born in November 2018, who had been genetically modified as embryos by the Chinese scientist He Jiankui.<ref name=""GuardianJiankui1"" /> The twins are believed to be the first genetically modified babies. The girls’ parents had participated in a clinical project run by He, which involved IVF, PGD and genome editing procedures in an attempt to edit the gene [[CCR5]]. CCR5 encodes a protein used by [[HIV]] to enter host cells, so by introducing a specific mutation into the gene [[CCR5#CCR5-Δ32|CCR5 Δ32]] He claimed that the process would confer [[innate resistance to HIV]].<ref name = ""MarchioneAPNews"">{{cite news | vauthors = Marchione M |title=Chinese researcher claims first gene-edited babies |url=https://www.apnews.com/4997bb7aa36c45449b488e19ac83e86d |publisher=AP News |date=26 Nov 2018}}</ref><ref name=""HIVdelta32"">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Silva E, Stumpf MP | title = HIV and the CCR5-Delta32 resistance allele | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 241 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15556703 | doi = 10.1016/j.femsle.2004.09.040 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The project run by He recruited couples wanting children where the man was [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] and the woman uninfected. During the project, He performed IVF with sperm and eggs from the couples and then introduced the CCR5 Δ32 mutation into the genomes of the embryos using CRISPR/Cas9. He then used PGD on the edited embryos during which he sequenced biopsied cells to identify whether the mutation had been successfully introduced. He reported some [[mosaicism]] in the embryos, whereby the mutation had integrated into some cells but not all, suggesting the offspring would not be entirely protected against HIV.<ref name=""statnewsJiankui"">{{cite news | vauthors = Begley S |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |publisher=Stat News |date=28 Nov 2018}}</ref> He claimed that during the PGD and throughout the pregnancy, [[Cell-free fetal DNA|foetal DNA]] was sequenced to check for off-target errors introduced by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, however the NIH released a statement in which they announced ""the possibility of damaging off-target effects has not been satisfactorily explored"".<ref name = ""NYtimesdefence"">{{cite news | vauthors = Belluck P |title=Chinese Scientist Who Says He Edited Babies' Genes Defends His Work |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/asia/gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html |work=The New York Times |date=28 Nov 2018}}</ref><ref name=""NIHJiankuiStatement"">{{cite news |title=Statement on Claim of First Gene-Edited Babies by Chinese Researcher |url=https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/statement-claim-first-gene-edited-babies-chinese-researcher |agency=National Institutes of Health |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=28 Nov 2018}}</ref> The girls were born in early November 2018, and were reported by He to be healthy.<ref name=""statnewsJiankui"" />

==Ethical considerations==
{{See also|Human germline engineering#Ethical and moral debates}}

Editing embryos, germ cells and the generation of designer babies is the subject of ethical debate, as a result of the implications in modifying genomic information in a heritable manner. This includes arguments over unbalanced gender selection and gamete selection.

Despite regulations set by individual countries’ governing bodies, the absence of a standardized regulatory framework leads to frequent discourse in discussion of germline engineering among scientists, ethicists and the general public. [[Arthur Caplan]], the head of the Division of Bioethics at [[New York University]] suggests that establishing an international group to set guidelines for the topic would greatly benefit global discussion and proposes instating “religious and ethics and legal leaders” to impose well-informed regulations.<ref name=""for against des baby"">{{cite news |title=Designer babies: the arguments for and against |url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/95108/designer-babies-the-arguments-for-and-against |work=The Week UK |date=17 Jul 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Since genetic modification poses risk to any [[organism]], researchers and medical professionals must give the prospect of germline engineering careful consideration. The main ethical concern is that these types of treatments will produce a change that can be passed down to future generations and therefore any error, known or unknown, will also be passed down and will affect the offspring.<ref name="":3"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson WF | title = Human gene therapy: scientific and ethical considerations | journal = The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–291 | date = August 1985 | pmid = 3900264 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/10.3.275 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Some bioethicists, including [[Ronald Michael Green|Ronald Green]] of [[Dartmouth College]], raise concern that this could result in the accidental introduction of new diseases in future.<ref name = ""Green 2007"">{{cite book | vauthors = Green RM | title = Babies By Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2007 | location = New Haven | pages = [https://archive.org/details/babiesbydesignet00gree/page/96 96–97] | id = 129954761 | isbn = 978-0-300-12546-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/babiesbydesignet00gree/page/96 }}</ref><ref name=""Agar2006"">{{cite journal| vauthors = Agar N |year=2006|title=Designer Babies: Ethical Considerations|url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/agar.html|website=ActionBioscience.org}}</ref>

When considering support for research into germline engineering, ethicists have often suggested that it can be considered unethical not to consider a technology that could improve the lives of children who would be born with [[congenital disorders]]. Geneticist George Church claims that he does not expect germline engineering to increase societal disadvantage, and recommends lowering costs and improving education surrounding the topic to dispel these views.<ref name = ""Guardianethics1"">{{cite news | vauthors = Sample I |title=Genetically modified babies given go-ahead by UK ethics body |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/17/genetically-modified-babies-given-go-ahead-by-uk-ethics-body |work=The Guardian |date=17 July 2018}}</ref> He emphasizes that allowing germline engineering in children who would otherwise be born with congenital defects could save around 5% of babies from living with potentially avoidable diseases. Jackie Leach Scully, professor of social and [[bioethics]] at [[Newcastle University]], acknowledges that the prospect of designer babies could leave those living with diseases and unable to afford the technology feeling marginalized and without medical support.<ref name=""Guardianethics1"" /> However, Professor Leach Scully also suggests that germline editing provides the option for parents “to try and secure what they think is the best start in life” and does not believe it should be ruled out. Similarly, [[Nick Bostrom]], an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[philosopher]] known for his work on the risks of [[artificial intelligence]], proposed that “super-enhanced” individuals could “change the world through their creativity and discoveries, and through innovations that everyone else would use”, highlighting not only a personal but societal benefit.<ref name = ""Bolstrom2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shulman C, Bostrom N |title=Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game-changer? |journal=Global Policy |date=February 2014 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=85–92 |doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12123}}</ref>

Many bioethicists emphasize that germline engineering is usually considered in the best interest of a child, therefore associated should be supported.

Conversely, several concerns have been raised regarding the possibility of generating designer babies, especially concerning the inefficiencies currently presented by the technologies. Bioethicist Ronald Green stated that although the technology was “unavoidably in our future”, he foresaw “serious errors and health problems as unknown genetic side effects in ‘edited’ children” arise.<ref name = ""Guardianethics2"">{{cite news | vauthors = Ball P |title=Designer babies: an ethical horror waiting to happen? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/08/designer-babies-ethical-horror-waiting-to-happen |work=The Guardian |date=8 January 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, Green warned against the possibility that “the well-to-do” could more easily access the technologies “..that make them even better off”. This concern regarding germline editing exacerbating a societal and financial divide is shared amongst other researches, with the chair of the Nuffield Bioethics Council Professor Karen Yeung stressing that if funding of the procedures “were to exacerbate social injustice, in our view that would not be an ethical approach”.<ref name=""Guardianethics1"" />

Social and religious worries also arise over the possibility of editing human embryos. In a survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Centre]], it was found that only a third of the Americans surveyed who identified as strongly [[Christianity|Christian]] approved of germline editing.<ref name = ""Morality DesBabies"">{{cite web |title=The Morality of ""Designer"" Babies |url=https://www.themonastery.org/blog/2016/07/morality-of-designer-babies/ |website=Universal Life Church Monastery Blog |date=28 July 2016}}</ref> Catholic leaders are in the middle ground. This stance is because, according to  Catholicism, a baby is a gift from God, and Catholics believe that people are created to be perfect in God's eyes. Thus, altering the genetic makeup of an infant is unnatural. In 1984, Pope John Paul II addressed that genetic manipulation in aiming to heal diseases is acceptable in the Church. He stated that it “will be considered in principle as desirable provided that it tends to the real promotion of the personal well-being of man, without harming his integrity or worsening his life conditions”.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/1999d/102299/102299j.htm |title=Designer babies, anyone?| vauthors = Schaeffer P |website=National Catholic Reporter}}</ref> However, it is unacceptable if designer babies are used to create a super/superior race including cloning humans. The Catholic Church rejects human cloning even if its purpose is to produce organs for therapeutic usage. The Vatican has stated that “The fundamental values connected with the techniques of artificial human procreation are two: the life of the human being called into existence and the special nature of the transmission of human life in marriage”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/document/instruction-on-respect-for-human-life-in-its-origin-and-on-the-dignity-of-procreation-117|title=INSTRUCTION ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE IN ITS ORIGIN AND ON THE DIGNITY OF PROCREATION}}</ref> According to them, it violates the dignity of the individual and is morally illicit.

A survey conducted by the Mayo Clinic in the Midwestern United States in 2017 saw that most of the participants agreed against the creation of designer babies with some noting its eugenic undertones.<ref name="":7"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Riggan KA, Sharp RR, Allyse M | title = Where Will We Draw the Line? Public Opinions of Human Gene Editing | journal = Qualitative Health Research | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1823–1835 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31057062 | doi = 10.1177/1049732319846867 | s2cid = 145819978 }}</ref> The participants also felt that gene editing may have unintended consequences that it may be manifested later in life for those that undergo gene editing.<ref name="":7"" /> Some that took the survey worried that gene editing may lead to a decrease in the genetic diversity of the population in societies.<ref name="":7"" /> The survey also noted how the participants were worried about the potential socioeconomic effects designer babies may exacerbate.<ref name="":7"" /> The authors of the survey noted that the results of the survey showed that there is a greater need for interaction between the public and the scientific community concerning the possible implications and the recommended regulation of gene editing as it was unclear to them how much those that participated knew about gene editing and its effects prior to taking the survey.<ref name="":7"" />

In Islam, the positive attitude towards genetic engineering is based on the general principle that Islam aims at facilitating human life. However, the negative view comes from the process used to create a Designer baby. Oftentimes, it involves the destruction of some embryos. Muslims believe that “embryos already has a soul” at conception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjw2fg8/revision/7|title=Gene therapy and genetic engineering|website=Bitesize}}</ref> Thus, the destruction of embryos is against the teaching of the Qur’an, Hadith, and Shari’ah law, that teaches our responsibility to protect human life. To clarify, the procedure would be viewed as “acting like God/Allah”.  With the idea, that parents could choose the gender of their child, Islam believes that humans have no decision to choose the gender, and that “gender selection is only up to God”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Bioethics| vauthors = Ali AB |publisher=Cham Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-18428-9}}</ref>

In 2020, There has been discussion about American studies that used embryos without embryonic implantation with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique that had been modified with HDR (homology-directed repair) and the conclusions from the results were that gene editing technologies are not mature enough currently for real world use and that there is a need for more studies that generate safe results over a longer period of time.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Uddin F, Rudin CM, Sen T | title = CRISPR Gene Therapy: Applications, Limitations, and Implications for the Future | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 10 | pages = 1387 | date = 2020 | pmid = 32850447 | pmc = 7427626 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2020.01387 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

An article in the journal, ''Bioscience Reports,'' discussed how health in terms of genetics is not straightforward and thus there should be extensive deliberation for operations involving gene editing when the technology gets mature enough for real world use where all of the potential effects are known on a case by case basis to prevent undesired effects on the subject or patient being operated on.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirakawa MP, Krishnakumar R, Timlin JA, Carney JP, Butler KS | title = Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives | journal = Bioscience Reports | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32207531 | pmc = 7146048 | doi = 10.1042/BSR20200127 }}</ref>

Social aspects also raise concern, as highlighted by Josephine Quintavelle, director of ''Comment on Reproductive Ethics'' at [[Queen Mary University of London]], who states that selecting children's traits is “turning parenthood into an unhealthy model of self-gratification rather than a relationship”.<ref name=""BMJDesBab"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Biggs H |title=Designer babies: where should we draw the line? |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=1 December 2004 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=e5 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.004465 |pmc=1733977 }}</ref>

One major worry among scientists, including [[Marcy Darnovsky]] at the [[Center for Genetics and Society]] in [[California]], is that permitting germline engineering for correction of disease phenotypes is likely to lead to its use for cosmetic purposes and enhancement.<ref name=""Guardianethics1"" /> Meanwhile, [[Henry Greely]], a bioethicist at [[Stanford University]] in California, states that “almost everything you can accomplish by gene editing, you can accomplish by embryo selection”, suggesting the risks undertaken by germline engineering may not be necessary.<ref name=""Guardianethics2"" /> Alongside this, Greely emphasizes that the beliefs that genetic engineering will lead to enhancement are unfounded, and that claims that we will enhance intelligence and personality are far off – “we just don’t know enough and are unlikely to for a long time – or maybe for ever”.

== Experimental workflow ==

=== CRISPR Single Guide RNA Library design and selection ===

[[File:Overview of Perturb-seq workflow.jpeg|thumb|517x517px|Overview of Perturb-seq workflow]]
Pooled CRISPR [[Library (biology)|libraries]] that enable gene inactivation can come in the form of either knockout or interference. Knockout libraries perturb genes through double stranded breaks that prompt the error prone [[non-homologous end joining]] repair pathway to introduce disruptive insertions or deletions. [[CRISPR interference]] (CRISPRi) on the other hand utilizes a catalytically inactive [[nuclease]] to physically block [[RNA polymerase]],  effectively preventing or halting [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Matthew H|last2=Gilbert|first2=Luke A|last3=Wang|first3=Xiaowo|last4=Lim|first4=Wendell A|last5=Weissman|first5=Jonathan S|last6=Qi|first6=Lei S|title=CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) for sequence-specific control of gene expression|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=8|issue=11|pages=2180–2196|doi=10.1038/nprot.2013.132|pmc=3922765|pmid=24136345|year=2013}}</ref> Perturb-seq has been utilized with both the knockout and CRISPRi approaches in the Dixit et al. paper <ref name="":1"" /> and the Adamson et al. paper,<ref name="":0"" /> respectively.

Pooling all guide RNAs into a single screen relies on DNA barcodes that act as identifiers for each unique guide RNA. There are several commercially available pooled CRISPR libraries including the guide barcode library used in the study by Adamson et al.<ref name="":0"" /> CRISPR libraries can also be custom made using tools for sgRNA design, many of which are listed on the [[CRISPR/Cas Tools|CRISPR/cas9 tools]] Wikipedia page.

=== Lentiviral vectors ===

The sgRNA expression vector design will depend largely on the experiment performed but requires the following central components: 
# [[Promoter (genetics)|'''Promoter''']]
# '''[[Restriction sites]]'''
# '''[[Primer (molecular biology)|Primer]] Binding Sites'''
# '''sgRNA'''
# '''Guide Barcode'''
# '''[[Reporter gene]]:'''
#* '''Fluorescent gene:''' vectors are often constructed to include a gene encoding a fluorescent protein, such that successfully transduced cells can be visually and quantitatively assessed by their expression. 
#* '''[[Antimicrobial resistance|Antibiotic resistance]] gene:''' similar to fluorescent markers, antibiotic resistance genes are often incorporated into vectors to allow for selection of successfully transduced cells.
# '''CRISPR-associated endonuclease:''' [[Cas9]] or other CRISPR-associated endonucleases such as [[Cpf1]] must be introduced to cells that do not endogenously express them. Due to the large size of these genes, a two-vector system can be used to express the endonuclease separately from the sgRNA expression vector.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite journal|last1=Shalem|first1=Ophir|last2=Sanjana|first2=Neville E.|last3=Hartenian|first3=Ella|last4=Shi|first4=Xi|last5=Scott|first5=David A.|last6=Mikkelsen|first6=Tarjei S.|last7=Heckl|first7=Dirk|last8=Ebert|first8=Benjamin L.|last9=Root|first9=David E.|date=2014-01-03|title=Genome-Scale CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening in Human Cells|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6166|pages=84–87|doi=10.1126/science.1247005|issn=0036-8075|pmc=4089965|pmid=24336571|bibcode=2014Sci...343...84S|hdl=1721.1/111576}}</ref>

=== Transduction and selection ===

Cells are typically [[Transduction (genetics)|transduced]] with a [[Multiplicity of Infection|Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)]] of 0.4 to 0.6 [[Lentiviral vector in gene therapy|lentiviral particles]] per cell to maximize the likelihood of obtaining the most amount of cells which contain a single guide RNA.<ref name="":3"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Tim|last2=Wei|first2=Jenny J.|last3=Sabatini|first3=David M.|last4=Lander|first4=Eric S.|date=2014-01-03|title=Genetic Screens in Human Cells Using the CRISPR-Cas9 System|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6166|pages=80–84|doi=10.1126/science.1246981|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3972032|pmid=24336569|bibcode=2014Sci...343...80W}}</ref> If the effects of simultaneous perturbations are of interest, a higher MOI may be applied to increase the amount of transduced cells with more than one guide RNA. Selection for successfully transduced cells is then performed using a fluorescence assay or an antibiotic assay, depending on the reporter gene used in the expression vector.

=== Single-cell library preparation ===

After successfully transduced cells have been selected for, isolation of single cells is needed to conduct scRNA-seq. Perturb-seq and CROP-seq have been performed using droplet-based technology for single cell isolation,<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":4"" /> while the closely related CRISP-seq was performed with a microwell-based approach.<ref name="":2"" /> Once cells have been isolated at the single cell level, [[reverse transcription]], amplification and sequencing takes place to produce gene expression profiles for each cell. Many scRNA-seq approaches incorporate [[unique molecular identifiers]] (UMIs) and cell barcodes during the reverse transcription step to index individual RNA molecules and cells, respectively. These additional barcodes serve to help quantify RNA transcripts and to associate each of the sequences with their cell of origin.

=== Bioinformatics analysis ===

Read alignment and processing are performed to map quality reads to a reference genome. Deconvolution of cell barcodes, guide barcodes and UMIs enables the association of guide RNAs with the cells that contain them, thus allowing the gene expression profile of each cell to be affiliated with a particular perturbation. Further downstream analyses on the transcriptional profiles will depend entirely on the biological question of interest. [[t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding|T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)]] is a commonly used [[machine learning]] algorithm to visualize the high-dimensional data that results from scRNA-seq in a 2-dimensional scatterplot.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":2"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Nicola K.|last2=Kent|first2=David G.|last3=Buettner|first3=Florian|last4=Shehata|first4=Mona|last5=Macaulay|first5=Iain C.|last6=Calero-Nieto|first6=Fernando J.|last7=Castillo|first7=Manuel Sánchez|last8=Oedekoven|first8=Caroline A.|last9=Diamanti|first9=Evangelia|title=Combined Single-Cell Functional and Gene Expression Analysis Resolves Heterogeneity within Stem Cell Populations|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=16|issue=6|pages=712–724|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2015.04.004|pmc=4460190|pmid=26004780|year=2015}}</ref> The authors who first performed Perturb-seq developed an in-house computational framework called MIMOSCA that predicts the effects of each perturbation using a linear model and is available on an open software repository.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/asncd/MIMOSCA|title = GitHub - asncd/MIMOSCA: A repository for the design and analysis of pooled single cell RNA-seq perturbation experiments|website = [[GitHub]]}}</ref>

== Advantages and limitations ==

Perturb-seq makes use of current technologies in molecular biology to integrate a multi-step workflow that couples high-throughput screening with complex phenotypic outputs. When compared to alternative methods used for gene knockdowns or knockouts, such as [[RNA interference|RNAi]], [[zinc finger nuclease]]s or [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs), the application of CRISPR-based perturbations enables more specificity, efficiency and ease of use.<ref name="":3"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Boettcher|first1=Michael|last2=McManus|first2=Michael T.|title=Choosing the Right Tool for the Job: RNAi, TALEN, or CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=58|issue=4|pages=575–585|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.028|pmc=4441801|pmid=26000843|year=2015}}</ref> Another advantage of this protocol is that while most screening approaches can only assay for simple phenotypes, such as cellular viability, scRNA-seq allows for a much richer phenotypic readout, with quantitative measurements of gene expression in many cells simultaneously.

However, while a large and comprehensive amount of data can be a benefit, it can also present a major challenge. Single cell RNA expression readouts are known to produce ‘noisy’ data, with a significant number of false positives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Serena|last2=Trapnell|first2=Cole|date=2016-02-17|title=Single-cell transcriptome sequencing: recent advances and remaining challenges|journal=F1000Research|volume=5|pages=182|doi=10.12688/f1000research.7223.1|pmc=4758375|pmid=26949524}}</ref> Both the large size and noise that is associated with scRNA-seq will likely require new and powerful computational methods and bioinformatics pipelines to better make sense of the resulting data. Another challenge associated with this protocol is the creation of large scale CRISPR libraries. The preparation of these extensive libraries depends upon a comparative increase in the resources required to culture the massive numbers of cells that are needed to achieve a successful screen of many perturbations.<ref name="":3"" />

In parallel to these single-cell methods, other approaches have been developed to reconstruct genetic pathways using whole-organism RNA-sequencing. These methods use a single aggregate statistic, called the transcriptome-wide epistasis coefficient, to guide pathway reconstruction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Angeles-Albores|first1=David|last2=Puckett Robinson|first2=Carmie|last3=Williams|first3=Brian A|last4=Wold|first4=Barbara J.|last5=Sternberg|first5=Paul W.|date=2018-03-27|title=Reconstructing a metazoan genetic pathway with transcriptome-wide epistasis measurements|journal=PNAS|volume=115|issue=13|pages=E2930–E2939|doi=10.1073/pnas.1712387115|pmc=5879656|pmid=29531064|doi-access=free}}</ref> In contrast with the statistical framework of the methods described above, this coefficient may be more robust to noise and is intuitively interpretable in terms of Batesonian epistasis.

== Applications ==
Perturb-seq or other conceptually similar protocols can be used to address a broad scope of biological questions and the applications of this technology will likely grow over time. Three papers on this topic, published in the December 2016 issue of the Journal Cell, demonstrated the utility of this method by applying it to the investigation of several distinct biological functions. In the paper, “Perturb-Seq: Dissecting Molecular Circuits with Scalable Single-Cell RNA Profiling of Pooled Genetic Screens”, the authors used Perturb-seq to conduct knockouts of [[transcription factors]] related to the [[immune response]] in hundreds of thousands of cells to investigate the cellular consequences of their inactivation.<ref name="":1"" /> They also explored the effects of transcription factors on cell states in the context of the [[cell cycle]]. In the study led by [[UCSF]], “A Multiplexed Single-Cell CRISPR Screening Platform Enables Systematic Dissection of the Unfolded Protein Response” the researchers suppressed multiple genes in each cell to study the [[unfolded protein response]] (UPR) pathway.<ref name="":0"" /> With a similar methodology, but using the term CRISP-seq instead of Perturb-seq, the paper ""Dissecting Immune Circuits by Linking CRISPR-Pooled Screens with Single-Cell RNA-Seq"" performed a proof of concept experiment by using the technique to probe regulatory pathways related to [[Innate immune system|innate immunity]] in mice.<ref name="":2"" /> Lethality of each perturbation and [[Epistasis and functional genomics|epistasis]] analyses in cells with multiple perturbations was also investigated in these papers. Perturb-seq has so far been used with very few perturbations per experiment, but it can theoretically be scaled up to address the whole genome. Finally, the October 2016 preprint<ref name="":5"" /> and subsequent paper<ref name="":4"" /> demonstrate the bioinformatic reconstruction of the T cell receptor signaling pathway in [[Jurkat cells|Jurkat]] cells based on CROP-seq data.

While these publications used these protocols for answering complex biological questions, this technology can also be used as a validation assay to ensure the specificity of any CRISPR based knockdown or knockout; the expression levels of the target genes as well as others can be measured with single cell resolution in parallel, to detect whether the perturbation was successful and to assess the experiment for off target effects. Furthermore, these protocols make it possible to perform perturbation screens in heterogeneous tissues, while obtaining cell type specific gene expression responses.

'''Human germline engineering''' is the process by which the [[genome]] of an individual is edited in such a way that the change is heritable.

While somatic gene therapy does change the genome of the targeted cells, these cells are not within the germline, so the alterations are not heritable and cannot be passed on to the next generation.

For safety, ethical, and social reasons, there is broad agreement among the scientific community and the public that germline editing is a red line that should not be crossed. Using germline editing for reproduction is prohibited by law in more than 40 countries and by a binding international treaty of the [[Council of Europe]]. However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene-editing technique [[CRISPR]]/[[Cas9]] to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique. This attempt was rather unsuccessful; only a small fraction of the embryos successfully incorporated the new genetic material and many of the embryos contained a large number of random mutations. The non-viable embryos that were used contained an extra set of chromosomes, which may have been problematic. In 2016, another similar study was performed in China which also used non-viable embryos with extra sets of chromosomes. This study showed very similar results to the first; there were successful integrations of the desired gene, yet the majority of the attempts failed, or produced undesirable mutations.

The most recent, and arguably most unsuccessful , experiment in August 2017 attempted the correction of the heterozygous [[MYBPC3]] mutation associated with [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] in human embryos with precise CRISPR–Cas9 targeting.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|last2=Reardon|first2=Sara| name-list-style = vanc |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-1.17378|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378|year=2015|s2cid=87604469}}</ref> 52% of human embryos were unsuccessfully to retain only the [[wild type]] normal copy of MYBPC3 gene, the rest of the embryos were [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]], where some cells in the [[zygote]] contained the normal gene copy and some contained the mutation.

== CRISPR-cas9 ==

Genome editing is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added,  removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed. CRISPR-Cas9, which is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9, is the most effective gene-editing technique to date. 

The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change into the DNA. An enzyme called [[Cas9]], acts as a pair of ‘molecular scissors’ that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that specific pieces of DNA can then be added or removed. A piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA) that consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence (about 20 bases long) located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence ‘guides’ Cas9 to the right part of the genome.

The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The gRNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormond KE, Mortlock DP, Scholes DT, Bombard Y, Brody LC, Faucett WA, Garrison NA, Hercher L, Isasi R, Middleton A, Musunuru K, Shriner D, Virani A, Young CE | display-authors = 6 | title = Human Germline Genome Editing | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–176 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28777929 | pmc = 5544380 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.012 }}</ref>  Scientists can use the DNA repair machinery to introduce changes to one or more genes in the genome of a cell of interest.

== Conceivable uses ==

[[The Berlin Patient]] has a genetic mutation in the [[CCR5]] gene (which codes for a protein on the surface of white blood cells, targeted by the HIV virus) that deactivates the expression of CCR5, conferring [[innate resistance to HIV]]. HIV/AIDS carries a large disease burden and is incurable (see [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS]]). One proposal is to genetically modify human embryos to give the CCR5 Δ32 allele to people.

There are many prospective uses such as curing genetic diseases and disorders. If perfected, somatic gene editing can promise helping people who are sick. In the first study published regarding human germline engineering, the researchers attempted to edit the ''[[HBB]]'' gene which codes for the human β-globin protein.<ref name="":1"" /> Mutations in the ''HBB'' gene result in the disorder [[Beta thalassemia|β-thalassaemia]], which can be fatal.<ref name="":1"" /> Perfect editing of the genome in patients who have these ''HBB'' mutations would result in copies of the gene which do not possess any mutations, effectively curing the disease. The importance of editing the germline would be to pass on this normal copy of the ''HBB'' genes to future generations.

Another possible use of human germline engineering would be [[Eugenics|eugenic]] modifications to humans which would result in what are known as ""[[Designer baby|designer babies]]"". The concept of a ""designer baby"" is that its entire genetic composition could be selected for.<ref name="":2"">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017.

The ability to germline engineer human genetic codes would be the beginning of eradicating incurable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, sickle-cell anemia and multiple forms of cancer that we cannot stop nor cure today.<ref>Lanphier, Edward, et al. “Don't Edit the Human Germ Line.” Nature News, Nature Publishing Group, 12 Mar. 2015, www.nature.com/news/don-t-edit-the-human-germ-line-1.17111</ref> Scientists having the technology to not only eradicate those existing diseases but to prevent them altogether in fetuses would bring a whole new generation of medical technology. There are numerous disease that humans and other mammals obtain that are fatal because scientists have not found a methodized ways to treat them. With germline engineering, doctors and scientists would have the ability to prevent known and future diseases from becoming an epidemic.

== State of research ==

The topic of human germline engineering is a widely debated topic. It is formally outlawed in more than 40 countries. Currently, 15 of 22 Western European nations have outlawed human germline engineering.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanphier E, Urnov F, Haecker SE, Werner M, Smolenski J | title = Don't edit the human germ line | journal = Nature | volume = 519 | issue = 7544 | pages = 410–1 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25810189 | doi = 10.1038/519410a | bibcode = 2015Natur.519..410L | doi-access = free }}</ref> Human germline modification has been for many years heavily off limits.  There is no current legislation in the United States that explicitly prohibits germline engineering, however, the ''Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2016'' banned the use of [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] funds to engage in research regarding human germline modifications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen IG, Adashi EY | title = SCIENCE AND REGULATION.

In 2014, it has been said about researchers in the US and China working on human embryos. In April 2015, a research team published an experiment in which they used CRISPR to edit a gene that is associated with blood disease in non-living human embryos. All these experiments were highly unsuccessful, but gene editing tools are used in labs.

Scientists using the CRISPR/cas9 system to modify genetic materials have run into issues when it comes to mammalian alterations due to the complex diploid cells. Studies have been done in microorganisms regarding loss of function genetic screening and some studies using mice as a subject. RNA processes differ between bacteria and mammalian cells and scientists have had difficulties coding for mRNA's translated data without the interference of RNA. Studies have been done using the cas9 nuclease that uses a single guide RNA to allow for larger knockout regions in mice which was successful.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Tim | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166| pages = 80–4 | doi = 10.1126/science.1246981 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...80W | pmc = 3972032 | pmid = 24336569 }}</ref> Altering the genetic sequence of mammals has also been widely debated thus creating a difficult FDA regulation standard for these studies.

The lack of clear international regulation has led to researchers across the globe attempting to create an international framework of ethical guidelines. Current framework lacks the requisite treaties among nations to create a mechanism for international enforcement. At the first International Summit on Human Gene Editing in December 2015 the collaboration of scientists issued the first international guidelines on genetic research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a|title=On Human Gene Editing: International Summit Statement|website=www8.nationalacademies.org|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> These guidelines allow for the pre-clinical research into the editing of genetic sequences in human cells granted the embryos are not used to implant pregnancy. Genetic alteration of somatic cells for therapeutic proposes was also considered an ethically acceptable field of research in part due to the lack of ability of somatic cells to transfer genetic material to subsequent generations. However citing the lack of social consensus, and the risk of inaccurate gene editing the conference called for restraint on any germline modifications on implanted embryos intended for pregnancy.

With the international outcry in response to the first recorded case of human germ line edited embryos being implanted by researcher [[He Jiankui]], scientists have continued discussion on the best possible mechanism for enforcement of an international framework. On March 13, 2019 researchers [[Eric Lander]], [[Francoise Baylis|Françoise Baylis]], [[Feng Zhang]], [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]], Paul Bergfrom along with others across the globe published a call for a framework that does not foreclose any outcome but includes a voluntary pledge by nations along with a coordinating body to monitor the application of pledged nations in a moratorium on human germline editing with an attempt to reach social consensus before moving forward into further research.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Germline gene-editing research needs rules | journal = Nature | volume = 567 | issue = 7747 | pages = 145 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30867612 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-00788-5 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[World Health Organization|The World Health Organization]] announced on December 18, 2018 plans to convene an intentional committee on clinical germline editing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/ethics/topics/human-genome-editing/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222155933/https://www.who.int/ethics/topics/human-genome-editing/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2019|title=WHO {{!}} Gene editing|website=WHO|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>

Editing the genes of human embryos is very different, and raises great social and ethical concerns. The scientific community, and global community, are quite divided regarding whether or not human germline engineering should be practiced or not. It is currently banned in many of the leading, developed countries, and highly regulated in the others due to ethical issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krause |first1=Kenneth W. |title=Editing the Human Germline: Groundbreaking Science and Mind-Numbing Sentiment |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=29–31}}</ref>

The [[American Medical Association]]’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs stated that ""genetic interventions to enhance traits should be considered permissible only in severely restricted situations: (1) clear and meaningful benefits to the fetus or child; (2) no trade-off with other characteristics or traits; and (3) equal access to the genetic technology, irrespective of income or other socioeconomic characteristics.""<ref>{{cite journal | title = Ethical issues related to prenatal genetic testing.

One of the most significant issues related to human genome editing relates to the impact of the technology on future individuals whose genes are modified without their consent. Clinical ethics accepts the idea that parents are, almost always, the most appropriate surrogate medical decision makers for their children until the children develop their own autonomy and decision-making capacity. This is based on the assumption that, except under rare circumstances, parents have the most to lose or gain from a decision and will ultimately make decisions that reflects the future values and beliefs of their children. By extension, we might assume that parents are the most appropriate decision makers for their future children as well. Although there are anecdotal reports of children and adults who disagree with the medical decisions made by a parent during pregnancy or early childhood, particularly when death was a possible outcome. Of note, there are also published patient stories by individuals who feel strongly that they would not wish to change or remove their own medical condition if given the choice and individuals who disagree with medical decisions made by their parents during childhood.<ref name="":4"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishii T | title = Potential impact of human mitochondrial replacement on global policy regarding germline gene modification | journal = Reproductive Biomedicine Online | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–5 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24832374 | doi = 10.1016/j.rbmo.2014.04.001 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The other ethical concern lies in the principle of “Designer Babies” or the creation of humans with ""perfect"", or ""desirable"" traits. There is a debate as to if this is morally acceptable as well. Such debate ranges from the ethical obligation to use safe and efficient technology to prevent disease to seeing some actual benefit in genetic disabilities.
There is a fear that the introduction of desirable traits in a certain part of the population (instead of the entire population) could cause economic inequalities (“positional” good){{Clarify|Aren't there already many positional goods as for example poor people may not always be able to pay treatments in hospitals?

While typically there is a clash between religion and science, the topic of human germline engineering has shown some unity between the two fields. Several religious positions have been published with regards to human germline engineering. According to them, many see germline modification as being more moral than the alternative, which would be either discarding of the embryo, or birth of a diseased human. The main conditions when it comes to whether or not it is morally and ethically acceptable lie within the intent of the modification, and the conditions in which the engineering is done.

The process of modifying the human genome has raised ethical questions. One of the issues is “off target effects”, large genomes may contain identical or homologous DNA sequences, and the enzyme complex CRISPR/Cas9 may unintentionally cleave these DNA sequences causing mutations that may lead to cell death. The mutations can cause important genes to be turned on or off, such as genetic anti-cancer mechanisms, that could speed up disease exasperation.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":5"">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3qsPJb44Q8C&pg=PR7 |title=Design and Destiny: Jewish and Christian Perspectives on Human Germline Modification|last=Cole-Turner|first=Ronald|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262533010}}</ref><ref name="":6"">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLjJ4AkYWUgC&pg=PR7 |title=Redesigning Humans: Choosing Our Genes, Changing Our Future|last=Stock|first=Gregory|date=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0618340835}}</ref><ref name="":7"">{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/87f48e99f9751939f95b6c2a3a18fa69/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1256|title=Germ-line gene modification and disease prevention: Some me - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref><ref name="":8"">{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/153890ac6d6289c595fb772a4602c1b2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=40569|title=A slippery slope to human germline modification - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>

Other ethical concerns are: unintentionally editing the human germline forever, not knowing how one change to a human germline will affect the expression of the remainder of the genes. A scientist recently made an apt analogy for us to understand in regard to mapping and manipulating the human genome / germline is in relation to a stage play: it is if we have very precise character descriptions (the mapped genome), and yet we (the scientific community) have no idea yet how the characters interact with each other. In other words, if one makes one change to the human germline, what other cascade of changes might we be making? <ref name=""Newson"">{{cite journal |last1=Newson |first1=A |title=Being Human: The Ethics, Law, and Scientific Progress of Genome Editing |journal=Australian Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=3 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |title=Sickle Cell Anemia: Stem Cell Therapy – Donald Kohn |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vbrC6mAS5A |website=YouTube |publisher=California Institute for Regenerative Medicine |access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref>

Another ethical concern pertains to potential unequal distribution of benefits, even if genome editing may be fairly inexpensive. For example, corporations may be able to take unfair advantage of patent law or other ways of restricting access to genome editing and thereby may increase the inequalities. There are already fights in the courts where CRISPR-Cas9 patents and access issues are being negotiated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Newson |first1=A |title=Being Human: The Ethics, Law, and Scientific Progress of Genome Editing |journal=Australian Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=3}}</ref>

== Genetically modified humans and designer babies ==
{{See|Designer baby}}
A genetically modified human contains a genetic makeup that has been selected or altered, often to include a particular gene or to remove genes associated with the disease. This process usually involves analyzing human embryos to identify genes associated with the disease, and selecting embryos that have the desired genetic makeup - a process known as a preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is a procedure in which embryos are screened prior to implantation. The technique is used alongside in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain embryos for evaluation of the genome – alternatively, ovocytes can be screened prior to fertilization. The technique was first used in 1989.

PGD is used primarily to select embryos for implantation in the case of possible genetic defects, allowing identification of mutated or disease-related alleles and selection against them. It is especially useful in embryos from parents where one or both carry a heritable disease. PGD can also be used to select for embryos of a certain sex, most commonly when a disease is more strongly associated with one sex than the other (as is the case for X-linked disorders which are more common in males, such as hemophilia). Infants born with traits selected following PGD are sometimes considered to be designer babies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/50284-are-tools-for-tweaking-embryonic-cells-ethical.html|title=Are Tools for Tweaking Embryonic Cells Ethical? (Op-Ed)|last1=Jin|first1=Shouguang|last2=March 27|first2=University of Florida {{!}}|website=Live Science|access-date=2018-12-05|last3=ET|first3=2015 01:17pm}}</ref>

One application of PGD is the selection of ‘savior siblings’, children who are born to provide a transplant (of an organ or group of cells) to a sibling with a usually life-threatening disease. Savior siblings are conceived through IVF and then screened using PGD to analyze genetic similarity to the child needing a transplant, in order to reduce the risk of rejection.

== PGD technique ==

Embryos for PGD are obtained from IVF procedures in which the oocyte is artificially fertilized by sperm. Oocytes from the woman are harvested following controlled ovarian hyper stimulation (COH), which involves fertility treatments to induce production of multiple oocytes. After harvesting the oocytes, they are fertilized in vitro, either during incubation with multiple sperm cells in culture, or via intracytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI), where sperm is directly injected into the oocyte.<ref name="":6"" /> Such tests include amniocentesis, ultrasounds, and other preimplantation genetic diagnostic tests. These tests are quite common, and reliable, as we talk about them today; however, in the past when they were first introduced, they too were scrutinized.<ref name="":6"" /> The resulting embryos are usually cultured for 3–6 days, allowing them to reach the blastomere or blastocyst stage.Once embryos reach the desired stage of development, cells are biopsied and genetically screened. The screening procedure varies based on the nature of the disorder being investigated.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a process in which DNA sequences are amplified to produce many more copies of the same segment, allowing screening of large samples and identification of specific genes. The process is often used when screening for monogenic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis.

Another screening technique, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) uses fluorescent probes which specifically bind to highly complementary sequences on chromosomes, which can then be identified using fluorescence microscopy. FISH is often used when screening for chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy, making it a useful tool when screening for disorders such as Down syndrome.<ref name="":6"" />

Following screening, embryos with the desired trait (or lacking an undesired trait such as a mutation) are transferred into the mother's uterus, then allowed to develop naturally.

== He Jiankui controversy and research ==

{{Main|He Jiankui affair}}

On 25 November 2018, two days before the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, [[He Jiankui|Jian-kui HE]], a Chinese researcher of the Southern University of Science and Technology, released a video on YouTube announcing that he and his colleagues have “created” the world’s first genetically altered babies, Lulu and Nana.

HE explained the details of his experiment -  in his address at the Hong Kong conference. HE and his team had recruited eight couples through an HIV volunteer group named Baihualin (BHL) China League (one couple later withdrew from the research). All the male participants are HIV-positive, and all female participants are HIV-negative. The participants’ sperm was “washed off” to get rid of HIV and then injected into eggs collected from the female participants. By using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9, a gene editing technique, they disabled a gene called [[CCR5]] in the embryos, aiming to close the protein doorway that allows HIV to enter a cell and make the subjects immune to the HIV virus. The process led to at least one successful pregnancy and the birth of the twin baby girls, [[Lulu and Nana]]. <ref name=Statuproar>{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT News |date=28 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=""sina1127"">{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2018-11-27/doc-ihpevhck8869227.shtml|title=复盘贺建奎的人生轨迹：是谁给了他勇气|publisher=[[sina.com.cn]]|date=27 November 2018|access-date=28 November 2018|language=zh}}</ref> Researcher [[Alcino J.

A major concern has been that He Jiankui’s attempts to cripple CCR5, the gene for a protein on immune cells that HIV uses to infect the cells, also made “off-target” changes elsewhere in the girls’ genomes. Those changes could cause cancer or other problems. He contends that the babies have no such off-target mutations, although some scientists are skeptical of the evidence offered so far.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/|title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies|date=2018-11-28|website=STAT|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>

People inherit two copies of CCR5, one from each parent. He chose the gene as a target because he knew that about 1% of Northern European populations are born with both copies missing 32 base pairs, resulting in a truncated protein that doesn’t reach the cell surface. These people, known as CCR5Δ32 [[homozygotes]], appear healthy and are highly resistant to HIV infection.
In the embryos, He’s team designed CRISPR to cut CCR5 at the base pair at one end of the natural deletion. The error-prone cell-repair mechanism, which CRISPR depends on to finish knocking out genes, then deleted 15 base pairs in one of Lulu’s copies of the gene, but none in the other. With one normal CCR5, she is expected to have no protection from HIV. Nana, according to the data He presented in a slide at an international genome-editing summit held in November 2018 in Hong Kong, China, had bases added to one CCR5 copy and deleted from the other, which likely would cripple both genes and provide HIV resistance.

He added the genes for the CRISPR machinery almost immediately after each embryo was created through in vitro fertilization, but several researchers who closely studied the slide caution that it may have done its editing after Nana’s embryo was already past the one-cell stage. That means she could be a genetic “mosaic” who has some unaffected cells with normal CCR5—and ultimately might have no protection from HIV.

Aside from the primary HIV concerns, the gene edits may have inadvertently altered cognitive function. Researchers showed in 2016 that knocking out one or both CCR5s in mice enhances their memory and cognition. A subsequent study that crippled CCR5 in mice found that, compared with control animals, the mutants recovered from strokes more quickly and had improved motor and cognitive functions following traumatic brain injury. The later study, in the 21 February issue of Cell, also included an analysis of 68 stroke patients who had one copy of CCR5 with the HIV resistance mutation; it concluded they had improved recovery, too. 

On the night of 26 November, 122 Chinese scientists issued a statement strongly condemning HE’s action as unethical. They stated that while CRISPR-Cas is not a new technology, it involves serious off-target risks and associated ethical considerations, and so should not be used to produce gene-altered babies. They described HE’s experiment as “crazy” and “a huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science”. The Scientific Ethics Committee of the Academic Divisions of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] posted a statement declaring their opposition to any clinical use of genome editing on human embryos, noting that “the theory is not reliable, the technology is deficient, the risks are uncontrollable, and ethics and regulations prohibit the action”.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein & Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}</ref>  The Chinese Academy of Engineering released a statement on 28 November, calling on scientists to improve self-discipline and self-regulation, and to abide by corresponding ethical principles, laws, and regulations. Finally, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences published a correspondence in The Lancet, stating that they are “opposed to any clinical operation of human embryo genome editing for reproductive purposes.""

== Major studies of influence ==

The first known publication of research into human germline editing was by a group of Chinese scientists in April 2015 in the Journal ""Protein and Cell"".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein & Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}</ref> The scientists used tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes, zygotes fertilized by two sperm and therefore non-viable, to investigate [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]]-mediated gene editing in human cells, something that had never been attempted before. The scientists found that while [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] could effectively cleave the [[HBB|β-globin gene (''HBB'')]], the efficiency of homologous recombination directed repair of ''[[HBB]]'' was highly inefficient and did not do so in a majority of the trials. Problems arose such as off target cleavage and the competitive recombination of the endogenous delta-globin with the ''[[HBB]]'' led to unexpected mutation. The results of the study indicated that repair of ''[[HBB]]'' in the embryos occurred preferentially through alternative pathways. In the end only 4 of the 54 zygotes carried the intended genetic information, and even then the successfully edited embryos were mosaics containing the preferential genetic code and the mutation. The conclusion of the scientists was that further effort was needed in to improve the precision and efficiency of [[CRISPR|CRISPER/Cas9]] gene editing.

In March 2017 a group of Chinese scientists claimed to have edited three normal viable human embryos out of six total in the experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang L, Zeng Y, Du H, Gong M, Peng J, Zhang B, Lei M, Zhao F, Wang W, Li X, Liu J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human zygotes using Cas9 protein | journal = Molecular Genetics and Genomics | volume = 292 | issue = 3 | pages = 525–533 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28251317 | doi = 10.1007/s00438-017-1299-z | s2cid = 16358211 }}</ref> The study showed that [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] is could effectively be used as a gene-editing tool in human 2PN zygotes, which could lead potentially pregnancy viable if implanted. The scientists used injection of Cas9 protein complexed with the relevant sgRNAs and homology donors into human embryos. The scientists found homologous recombination-mediated alteration in ''[[HBB]]'' and ''[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase|G6PD]]''. The scientists also noted the limitations of their study and called for further research.

In August 2017 a group of scientists from Oregon published an article in ''Nature'' journal detailing the successful use of [[CRISPR]] to edit out a mutation responsible for congenital heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma H, Marti-Gutierrez N, Park SW, Wu J, Lee Y, Suzuki K, Koski A, Ji D, Hayama T, Ahmed R, Darby H, Van Dyken C, Li Y, Kang E, Park AR, Kim D, Kim ST, Gong J, Gu Y, Xu X, Battaglia D, Krieg SA, Lee DM, Wu DH, Wolf DP, Heitner SB, Belmonte JC, Amato P, Kim JS, Kaul S, Mitalipov S | display-authors = 6 | title = Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 548 | issue = 7668 | pages = 413–419 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28783728 | doi = 10.1038/nature23305 | bibcode = 2017Natur.548..413M | doi-access = free }}</ref> &nbsp;The study looked at heterozygous ''[[Myosin binding protein C, cardiac|MYBPC3]]'' mutation in human embryos. The study claimed precise [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and precision. Double-strand breaks at the mutant paternal allele were repaired using the homologous wild-type gene. By modifying the cell cycle stage at which the DSB was induced, they were able to avoid mosaicism, which had been seen in earlier similar studies, in cleaving embryos and achieve a large percentage of homozygous embryos carrying the wild-type ''[[Myosin binding protein C, cardiac|MYBPC3]]'' gene without evidence of unintended mutations. The scientists concluded that the technique may be used for the correction of mutations in human embryos. The claims of this study were however pushed back on by critics who argued the evidence was overall unpersuasive.

In June 2018 a group of scientists published and article in ""Nature"" journal indicating a potential link for edited cells having increased potential turn cancerous.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haapaniemi E, Botla S, Persson J, Schmierer B, Taipale J | title = CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing induces a p53-mediated DNA damage response | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 927–930 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29892067 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-018-0049-z | hdl = 10138/303675 | s2cid = 47018050 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> The scientists reported that genome editing by [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] induced DNA damage response and the cell cycle stopped. The study was conducted in human retinal pigment epithelial cells, and the use of [[CRISPR]] led to a selection against cells with a functional [[p53]] pathway. The conclusion of the study would suggest that [[p53]] inhibition might increase efficiency of human germline editing and that [[p53]] function would need to be watched when developing [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] based therapy.

In November 2018 a group of Chinese scientists published research in the journal ""Molecular Therapy"" detailing their use of [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] technology to correct a single mistaken amino acid successfully in 16 out of 18 attempts in a human embryo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeng Y, Li J, Li G, Huang S, Yu W, Zhang Y, Chen D, Chen J, Liu J, Huang X | title = Correction of the Marfan Syndrome Pathogenic FBN1 Mutation by Base Editing in Human Cells and Heterozygous Embryos | language = en | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 2631–2637 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30166242 | pmc = 6224777 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.08.007 | url = }}</ref> The unusual level of precision was achieved by the use of a base editor (BE) system which was constructed by fusing the deaminase to the dCas9 protein. The BE system efficiently edits the targeted C to T or G to A without the use of a donor and without DBS formation. The study focused on the ''FBN1'' mutation that is causative for [[Marfan syndrome]]. The study provides proof positive for the corrective value of gene therapy for the ''FBN1'' mutation in both somatic cells and germline cells. The study is noted for its relative precision which is a departure from past results of [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] studies.

{{about|a method to identify the functions of [[gene]]s|screening or testing for genetic diseases|genetic testing}}
A '''genetic screen''' or '''mutagenesis screen'''  is an experimental technique used to identify and select for individuals who possess a [[phenotype]] of interest in a mutagenized population.<ref name=""Hartwell_2008"">{{cite book | vauthors = Hartwell LH, Hood L, Goldberg ML, Reynolds AE, Silver LM, Veres RC | title = Genetics: from genes to genomes | publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education | location = Boston | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-07-284846-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/genetics00lela_0 }}</ref>  Hence a genetic screen is a type of [[phenotypic screen]].

== Basic screening ==

'''[[Forward genetics]]''' (or a forward genetic screen) starts with a phenotype and then attempts to identify the causative mutation and thus gene(s) responsible for the phenotype. For instance, the famous screen by [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] and [[Eric F. Wieschaus|Eric Wieschaus]] mutagenized fruit flies and then set out to find the genes causing the observed mutant phenotypes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nüsslein-Volhard|first=C.|last2=Wieschaus|first2=E.|date=1980-10-30|title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6776413|journal=Nature|volume=287|issue=5785|pages=795–801|doi=10.1038/287795a0|issn=0028-0836|pmid=6776413}}</ref>

Successful forward genetic screens often require a defined genetic background of and a simple experimental procedure. That is, when multiple individuals are mutagenized they should be genetically identical so that their wild type phenotype is identical too and mutant phenotypes are easier to identify.  A simple screening method allows for a larger number of individuals to be screened, thereby increasing the probability of generating and identifying mutants of interest.<ref name = ""Arabidopsis""/>

Since natural [[allele|allelic]] mutations are rare, prior to screening geneticists often mutagenize a population of individuals by exposing them to a known [[mutagen]], such as a chemical or radiation, thereby generating a much higher frequency of [[chromosome|chromosomal mutations]].<ref name=Hartwell_2008/>  In some organisms [[Mutagen|mutagens]] are used to perform '''saturation screens''', that is, a screen used to uncover ''all'' genes involved in a particular phenotype. [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] and [[Eric Wieschaus]] were the first individuals to perform this type of screening procedure in animals.<ref name=SatS>{{cite web | title = Genetic Screen | url = http://www.stemcellsresearch.net/genetic-screen/ | publisher = Stem Cells Research | access-date = 2012-05-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120401224012/http://www.stemcellsresearch.net/genetic-screen/ | archive-date = 2012-04-01 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

'''[[Reverse genetics]]''' (or a reverse genetic screen), starts with a known gene and assays the effect of its disruption by analyzing the resultant phenotypes. For example, in a knock-out screen one or more genes are completely deleted and the deletion mutants are tested for phenotypes. Such screens have been done for all genes in many bacteria and even complex organisms, such as ''C. elegans''.<ref name=""Hartwell_2008"" /> Reverse genetic screen typically begins with a gene sequence followed by targeted inactivation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boutros |first1=Michael |last2=Ahringer |first2=Julie |title=The art and design of genetic screens: RNA interference |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=July 2008 |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=554–566 |doi=10.1038/nrg2364 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg2364 |language=en |issn=1471-0064}}</ref> Moreover, it induces mutations in model organisms to learn their role in disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurumurthy |first1=Channabasavaiah B. |last2=Grati |first2=M’hamed |last3=Ohtsuka |first3=Masato |last4=Schilit |first4=Samantha L.

== Screening variations ==

Many screening variations have been devised to elucidate a gene that leads to a mutant phenotype of interest.

=== Enhancer ===

An '''enhancer screen''' begins with a mutant individual that has an affected process of interest with a known gene mutation.  The screen can then be used to identify additional genes or gene mutations that play a role in that biological or physiological process. A genetic enhancer screen identifies mutations which enhance a phenotype of interest in an already mutant individual.  The phenotype of the double mutant (individual with both the enhancer and original background mutation) is more prominent than either of the single mutant phenotypes.  The enhancement must surpass the expected phenotypes of the two mutations on their own, and therefore each mutation may be considered an enhancer of the other.  Isolating enhancer mutants can lead to the identification of interacting genes or genes which act redundantly with respect to one another.<ref name= WormE>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herman RK, Yochem J | title = Genetic enhancers | journal = WormBook | pages = 1–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 18023119 | doi = 10.1895/wormbook.1.27.1 | pmc = 4780930 }}</ref>

=== Suppressor ===

A '''suppressor screen''' is used to identify [[suppressor mutation]]s which alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as [[synthetic viability]].<ref name=""Puddu2015"">{{cite journal|last1=Puddu|first1=F.|last2=Oelschlaegel|first2=T|last3=Guerini|first3=I|last4=Geisler|first4=NJ|last5=Niu|first5=H|last6=Herzog|first6=M|last7=Salguero|first7=I|last8=Ochoa-Montaño|first8=B|last9=Viré|first9=E|last10=Sung|first10=P|last11=Adams|first11=DJ|last12=Keane|first12=TM|last13=Jackson|first13=SP|title=Synthetic viability genomic screening defines Sae2 function in DNA repair|journal=EMBO Journal |date=2015|issue=11|pages=1509–1522|doi=10.15252/embj.201590973|pmid=25899817|volume=34|pmc=4474527}}</ref> Suppressor mutations can be described as second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation.<ref name= WormS>{{cite journal | author = Hodgkin J | title = Genetic suppression | journal = WormBook | pages = 1–13 | year = 2005 | pmid = 18023120 | doi = 10.1895/wormbook.1.59.1 | pmc = 4781008 }}</ref> If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as [[Suppressor mutation#Intragenic vs. Intergenic Suppression|intragenic suppression]], whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as [[Suppressor mutation#Intragenic vs. Intergenic Suppression|extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression]].<ref name=Hartwell_2008/> Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.

=== Temperature sensitive ===

A '''temperature sensitive screen''' involves performing temperature shifts to enhance a mutant phenotype.  A population grown at low temperature would have a normal phenotype; however, the mutation in the particular gene would make it unstable at a higher temperature.  A screen for temperature sensitivity in fruit flies, for example, might involve raising the [[temperature]] in the cage until some flies faint, then opening a portal to let the others escape. Individuals selected in a screen are liable to carry an unusual version of a [[gene]] involved in the phenotype of interest. An advantage of alleles found in this type of screen is that the mutant phenotype is [[:wikt:conditional|conditional]] and can be activated by simply raising the temperature. A [[null mutation]] in such a gene may be lethal to the embryo and such mutants would be missed in a basic screen. A famous temperature sensitive screen was carried out independently by [[Lee Hartwell]] and [[Paul Nurse]] to identify mutants defective in cell cycle in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe|S. pombe]]'', respectively.

=== RNAi ===
[[File:RNAi-overview-embryo.png|thumb|An overview of RNA interference (RNAi) embryonic injection method.]]

[[RNA interference|RNA interference (RNAi)]] screen is essentially a forward genetics screen using a reverse genetics technique. Similar to classical genetic screens in the past, large-scale RNAi surveys success depends on a careful development of phenotypic assays and their interpretation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boutros |first1=Michael |last2=Ahringer |first2=Julie |title=The art and design of genetic screens: RNA interference |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=July 2008 |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=554–566 |doi=10.1038/nrg2364 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg2364 |language=en |issn=1471-0064}}</ref> In [[Drosophila]], RNAi has been applied in cultured cells or in vivo to investigate gene functions and to effect the function of single genes on a genome-wide scale. RNAi is used to silence gene expression in Drosophila by injecting dsRNA into early embryos, and interfering with [[Frizzled]] and Frizzled2 genes creating defects in embryonic patterning that mimic loss of wingless function.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heigwer |first1=Florian |last2=Port |first2=Fillip |last3=Boutros |first3=Michael |title=RNA Interference (RNAi) Screening in Drosophila |journal=Genetics |date=1 March 2018 |volume=208 |issue=3 |pages=853–874 |doi=10.1534/genetics.117.300077 |url=https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.117.300077 |issn=1943-2631}}</ref>

=== CRISPR ===
[[File:CRISPR Cas system.png|thumb|[[CRISPR/Cas12a|Cas12a]] in complex with crRNA and target DNA -- the key tool for CRISPR screens.]]

[[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas]] is primarily used for reverse genetic screens. CRISPR has the ability to create libraries of thousands of precise genetic mutations and can identify new tumors as well as validate older tumors in cancer research. [[Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens|Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO)]] library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer. Bacterial [[Cas9|CRISPR–Cas9]] system for engineering both loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutations in untransformed human intestinal organoids in order to demonstrate a model of [[Colorectal cancer|Colorectal cancer (CRC)]]. It can also be used to study functional consequences of mutations in vivo by enabling direct genome editing in somatic cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurumurthy |first1=Channabasavaiah B. |last2=Grati |first2=M’hamed |last3=Ohtsuka |first3=Masato |last4=Schilit |first4=Samantha L. P. |last5=Quadros |first5=Rolen M. |last6=Liu |first6=Xue Zhong |title=CRISPR: a versatile tool for both forward and reverse genetics research |journal=Human Genetics |date=1 September 2016 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=971–976 |doi=10.1007/s00439-016-1704-4 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-016-1704-4 |language=en |issn=1432-1203}}</ref>

== Mapping mutants ==
{{Anchor|Heidelberg screen}}
By the [[classical genetics]] approach, a researcher would then locate (map) the gene on its [[chromosome]] by [[crossbreeding]] with individuals that carry other unusual [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s and collecting statistics on how frequently the two traits are inherited together. Classical geneticists would have used phenotypic traits to map the new mutant [[allele]]s. With the advent of genomic sequences for model systems such as ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]],'' ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' many [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) have now been identified that can be used as traits for mapping. In fact, the '''Heidelberg screen''', allowing mass testing of mutants and developed in 1980 by [[Nüsslein-Volhard]] and [[Eric F. Wieschaus|Wieschaus]], cleared the way for future scientists in this field.<ref name=""stj"">{{cite journal |pmid=11972155|year=2002|last1=St Johnston|first1=D.|title=The art and design of genetic screens: Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Nature Reviews. Genetics|volume=3|issue=3|pages=176–88|doi=10.1038/nrg751}}</ref> SNPs are the preferred traits for mapping since they are very frequent, on the order of one difference per 1000 base pairs, between different varieties of organism. Mutagens such as random DNA insertions by [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] or active [[Transposable elements|transposons]] can also be used to generate new mutants. These techniques have the advantage of tagging the new alleles with a known molecular [[Genetic marker|(DNA) marker]] that can facilitate the rapid identification of the gene.<ref name=SatS/>

== Positional cloning ==

Positional cloning is a method of gene identification in which a gene for a specific phenotype is identified only by its approximate chromosomal location (but not the function); this is known as the [[Candidate gene|candidate region]].  Initially, the candidate region can be defined using techniques such as [[linkage analysis]], and positional cloning is then used to narrow the candidate region until the gene and its mutations are found.  Positional cloning typically involves the isolation of partially overlapping DNA segments from genomic libraries to progress along the chromosome toward a specific gene. During the course of positional cloning, one needs to determine whether the DNA segment currently under consideration is part of the gene.

Tests used for this purpose include cross-species hybridization, identification of unmethylated [[CpG islands]], [[exon trapping]], direct [[cDNA]] selection, computer analysis of DNA sequence, mutation screening in affected individuals, and tests of gene expression. For genomes in which the regions of [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|genetic polymorphisms]] are known, positional cloning involves identifying polymorphisms that flank the mutation. This process requires that DNA fragments from the closest known genetic marker are progressively cloned and sequenced, getting closer to the mutant allele with each new clone.  This process produces a [[contig map]] of the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] and is known as [[chromosome walking]].  With the completion of genome sequencing projects such as the [[Human Genome Project]], modern positional cloning can use ready-made contigs from the genome sequence databases directly.

For each new [[DNA clone]] a polymorphism is identified and tested in the mapping population for its [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] frequency compared to the mutant phenotype. When the DNA clone is at or close to the mutant allele, the recombination frequency should be close to zero.  If the chromosome walk proceeds through the mutant allele, the new polymorphisms will start to show increase in recombination frequency compared to the mutant phenotype.  Depending on the size of the mapping population, the mutant allele can be narrowed down to a small region (<30 Kb).  Sequence comparison between [[wild type]] and [[mutant]] DNA in that region is then required to locate the DNA [[mutation]] that causes the phenotypic difference.

Modern positional cloning can more directly extract information from genomic sequencing projects and existing data by analyzing the genes in the candidate region.  Potential disease genes from the candidate region can then be prioritized, potentially reducing the amount of work involved.  Genes with expression patterns consistent with the disease phenotype, showing a (putative) function related to the phenotype, or homologous to another gene linked to the phenotype are all priority candidates.  Generalization of positional cloning techniques in this manner is also known as positional gene discovery.

Positional cloning is an effective method to isolate disease genes in an unbiased manner and has been used to identify disease genes for [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], [[Huntington's disease]], and [[cystic fibrosis]].  However, complications in the analysis arise if the disease exhibits locus heterogeneity.

In order to extrapolate this method into eukaryotes in order to develop a gene editing method, a Cas9 protein, a recognition sequence RNA, and a transactivating RNA are required. The fusion of both the recognition sequence specificity CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating RNA (tracrRNA) is commonly used in experiments and called a single guide RNA (sgRNA).<ref name=""Cong_2013"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cong L, Ran FA, Cox D, Lin S, Barretto R, Habib N, Hsu PD, Wu X, Jiang W, Marraffini LA, Zhang F | title = Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems | journal = Science | volume = 339 | issue = 6121 | pages = 819–23 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23287718 | pmc = 3795411 | doi = 10.1126/science.1231143 | bibcode = 2013Sci...339..819C }}</ref> It performs both functions: the first 20 nucleotides of the sgRNA are complementary to the DNA target sequence (cr function), while the nucleotides following are part of a [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM; tracr function).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Almendros C | title = Short motif sequences determine the targets of the prokaryotic CRISPR defence system | journal = Microbiology | volume = 155 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 733–40 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19246744 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.023960-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternberg SH, Redding S, Jinek M, Greene EC, Doudna JA | title = DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 507 | issue = 7490 | pages = 62–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24476820 | pmc = 4106473 | doi = 10.1038/nature13011 | bibcode = 2014Natur.507...62S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anders C, Niewoehner O, Duerst A, Jinek M | title = Structural basis of PAM-dependent target DNA recognition by the Cas9 endonuclease | journal = Nature | volume = 513 | issue = 7519 | pages = 569–73 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25079318 | doi = 10.1038/nature13579 | pmc = 4176945 | bibcode = 2014Natur.513..569A }}</ref>

Off-targeting nuclease binding originates from a partial but sufficient match to the target sequence.

=== Base mismatch tolerance ===

While the Cas9 specificity is believed to be controlled by the 20nt sgRNA and PAM, off-target mutations are still prevalent and could occur with as many as 3-5 base pair mismatches (out of 20) between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence.<ref name=""Cong_2013"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Scott DA, Weinstein JA, Ran FA, Konermann S, Agarwala V, Li Y, Fine EJ, Wu X, Shalem O, Cradick TJ, Marraffini LA, Bao G, Zhang F | title = DNA targeting specificity of RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 827–32 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23873081 | pmc = 3969858 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2647 }}</ref> Furthermore, sgRNA secondary structures could also affect cleavage of on-target and off-target sites. As mentioned above, sgRNA consists of a sequence (~20nt) which is complementary to the target sequences and this is followed by a PAM sequence which activates the [[endonuclease]] activity. While it was shown that 10-12 nt adjacent to PAM (called the “seed sequence”) was enough for Cas9 specificity, Wu ''et al.'' showed that in a catalytically dead Cas9 only 1-5 base pairs of seed sequence is required for specificity.<ref name=""Wu_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu X, Scott DA, Kriz AJ, Chiu AC, Hsu PD, Dadon DB, Cheng AW, Trevino AE, Konermann S, Chen S, Jaenisch R, Zhang F, Sharp PA | title = Genome-wide binding of the CRISPR endonuclease Cas9 in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 670–6 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24752079 | pmc = 4145672 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2889 }}</ref> This was later proven by other studies as well. The Cas9 protein binding is further affected by a number of mechanisms:
* The seed sequence determines the frequency of a seed plus PAM in the genome and controls the effective concentration of Cas9 sgRNA complex.
* Uracil-rich seeds are likely to have low sgRNA levels and increase specificity since multiple uracil in the sequence can introduce termination of the sgRNA [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]].<ref name=""Wu_2014"" /><ref name=""Wang_2014"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang T, Wei JJ, Sabatini DM, Lander ES | title = Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 80–4 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336569 | pmc = 3972032 | doi = 10.1126/science.1246981 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...80W }}</ref>
* Mismatches in the 5’ end of the crRNA are more tolerated as the important site would be adjacent to the PAM matrix. Single and double mismatches are also tolerated based on how to place it.
* In a recent study, Ren ''et al.'' observed a link between mutagenesis efficiency and GC content of sgRNA.

* While picking a gRNA, guanine is preferred over cytosine as the first base of the seed adjacent to PAM, cytosine as the first in the 5’ and adenine in the middle of the sequence.

* A [[ChIP]] was performed by Kim ''et al.'' showcasing that addition of a purified Cas9 along with the sgRNA caused low off target effects which means that there are more factors causing these effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Kim D, Cho SW, Kim J, Kim JS | title = Highly efficient RNA-guided genome editing in human cells via delivery of purified Cas9 ribonucleoproteins | journal = Genome Research | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 1012–9 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24696461 | pmc = 4032847 | doi = 10.1101/gr.171322.113 }}</ref>
It is important to note that DNA methylation of CpG sites reduces efficiency of binding of Cas9 and other factors in cells. Therefore, there is an epigenetic link which will be explored more for the future of epigenome editing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuscu C, Arslan S, Singh R, Thorpe J, Adli M | title = Genome-wide analysis reveals characteristics of off-target sites bound by the Cas9 endonuclease | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 677–83 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24837660 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2916 | s2cid = 29285105 }}</ref> [[File:Schematic of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target sites with DNA bulge and RNA bulge.jpg|thumb|upright=3| Graphical explanation of DNA and RNA bulge.]] Variations within the PAM sequence can also affect sgRNA activity, in turn affecting the sgRNA itself. In commonly used Cas9 systems, the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity problems as some regions will have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. A report stated that 99.96% of sites previously assumed to be unique Cas9 targets in human exons may have potential off target effects containing NAG or NGG PAM and a single base mismatch in the seed sequence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Aach J, Stranges PB, Esvelt KM, Moosburner M, Kosuri S, Yang L, Church GM | title = CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 833–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23907171 | pmc = 3818127 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2675 }}</ref>

===  Bulge mismatch  ===

Both off target sites with missing bases (or deletions) and off target sites with extra bases (or insertions) called RNA bulge and DNA bulge respectively, have effects in Cas9 specificity and cleavage activity. Lin ''et al.'' mimicked these bulges by adding and deleting bases from the sgRNA sequence such that a base deletion in the sgRNA would yield an RNA bulge and a base insertion would yield a DNA bulge.<ref name=""Lin_2014"" /> By studying the mutation rates via NHEJ, they came to the following results:
* In case of pure DNA bulges, the mutations were well tolerated (i.e. Cas9 cleavage activity was still prevalent). The regions of bulge tolerance included seven bases from the PAM and the 5’ and 3’ ends of the seed sequence. This resulted in similar or slightly higher (in some cases) mutations as compared to zero bulges.
* In case of purely RNA bulges, higher Cas9 activity was induced at many positions as compared to DNA bulges. This characteristic was attributed to the fact that RNA is more flexible than DNA and thus has a smaller binding penalty with RNA bulge resulting in a higher tolerance and higher off target mutations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last=Alberts B., Johnson A., Lewis J., Raff M., Roberts K., Walter P.|publisher=New York: Garland Science|year=2007}}</ref>
* Higher GC content of the sgRNA sequence resulted in a higher tolerance and thus, a higher off target mutation rate.
* Bulges of 2bp-5bp strikingly were more tolerant and mutation inducing than a single 2bp bulge.

=== Methods to increase specificity ===
The widely used ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies. Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off-target mutations including nuclease mutation, [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence modification, [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadam US, Shelake RM, Chavhan RL, Suprasanna P | year = 2018 | title = Concerns regarding 'off-target' activity of genome editing endonucleases | journal = Ant Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 131 | pages = 22–30 | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.03.027 | pmid = 29653762 }}</ref> For example, in 2013, Fu ''et al.'' reported that by truncating the gRNA from <20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred.<ref name=""Fu_2014b"" />

==== Cas9 nickases ====
The spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. Nuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as [[Cas9 nickases]]. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage.<ref name=""Cho_2014"" /> Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands.<ref name=""Cho_2014"" /> Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co-localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target [[indel]]s.<ref name=""Cho_2014"" /> Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions.

==== Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases ====
As [[monomer]]ic nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] is an attractive strategy. In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or ‘half-sites’ and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off-target effects. A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization-dependent [[FokI]] nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed.<ref name=""Tsai_2014b"" /> The FokI nuclease was originally found in ''[[Flavobacterium okeanokoites]]'', and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. Basically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9).<ref name=""Tsai_2014b"" /> The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1. It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing.<ref name=""Tsai_2014b"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wyvekens N, Topkar VV, Khayter C, Joung JK, Tsai SQ | title = Dimeric CRISPR RNA-Guided FokI-dCas9 Nucleases Directed by Truncated gRNAs for Highly Specific Genome Editing | journal = Human Gene Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26068112 | pmc = 4509490 | doi = 10.1089/hum.2015.084 }}</ref>

==== Nuclease mutation ====
In addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM. In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects.<ref name=""Kleinstiver_2015"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Topkar VV, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Gonzales AP, Li Z, Peterson RT, Yeh JR, Aryee MJ, Joung JK | title = Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | issue = 7561 | pages = 481–5 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26098369 | pmc = 4540238 | doi = 10.1038/nature14592 | bibcode = 2015Natur.523..481K }}</ref> A [[D1135E mutant]] appears to alter PAM specificities.

== Detection  ==

Even though one might take careful measures to avoid off-target mutations, and even if one succeeds, a confirmatory screen needs to be done in order to screen for unintended mutations. Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two ''in vitro'' methods. All of these are listed below:

=== Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing ===

In case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time-consuming and expensive once more target sites are added. [[Exome sequencing]] utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome. It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome. In case of [[whole genome sequencing]], the entire genome is screened for off target mutations. Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zischewski J, Fischer R, Bortesi L | title = Detection of on-target and off-target mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and other sequence-specific nucleases | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–104 | pmid = 28011075 | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.003 | year = 2017 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== BLESS ===
[[File:Methods_of_detecting_off_target_mutations.jpg|thumb|upright=3|An overview of different methods for detection of off target mutations by genome editing. A) BLESS B) GUIDE-seq C) HTGTS D) Digenome-Seq]]
[[BLESS]] is the easiest way to detect and quantify off-target mutations by screening for DSBs in the genome. This method relies on direct ''in situ'' breaks labeling enrichment on streptavidin. Developed in 2013,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crosetto N, Mitra A, Silva MJ, Bienko M, Dojer N, Wang Q, Karaca E, Chiarle R, Skrzypczak M, Ginalski K, Pasero P, Rowicka M, Dikic I | title = Nucleotide-resolution DNA double-strand break mapping by next-generation sequencing | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–5 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23503052 | pmc = 3651036 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2408 }}</ref> BLESS is performed by ligating the DSB ends with biotin i.e. biotinylation. This is followed by separation/collection of said ligated ends using streptavidin. A linked sequence is added to the biotinylated sequences and this final mix is then sequenced to yield the position of the off target mutation. Being unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai SQ, Joung JK | title = Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 300–12 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27087594 | doi = 10.1038/nrg.2016.28 | pmc = 7225572 }}</ref>

=== LAM-HTGTS ===

Linear Amplification Mediated - High Throughput Genome Wide Translocation Sequencing, or LAM-HTGTS, is a method developed to track translocation events caused by joining between DSBs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mallin H, Hestericová M, Reuter R, Ward TR | title = Library design and screening protocol for artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 835–52 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27031496 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2016.019 | s2cid = 22365528 }}</ref> Developed to detect off-target mutations from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, this technique is based on DNA repair by end joining in DSBs. Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations. Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved. Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation. Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers. In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence. The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations. One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB.

=== GUIDE-Seq ===

Another approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the [[GUIDE-Seq]] method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DSBs Enabled by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ. Its amplification is followed by sequencing. Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified. Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation. This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%. Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study.

=== Digenome-Seq ===

One of the current ''in vitro'' methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome. In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing. Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned. Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%.<ref name=""Kim_2015""/> The main advantage, however, is that this method is ''in vitro'' i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu BX, St Onge RP, Fire AZ, Smith JD | title = Distinct patterns of Cas9 mismatch tolerance in vitro and in vivo | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 5365–77 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27198218 | pmc = 4914125 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw417 }}</ref>

=== CIRCLE-Seq ===

The latest addition to the ''in vitro'' methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq. Licensed by Beacon genomics (along with GUIDE-seq),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beacongenomics.com/news/press-releases/circle-seq|title=CIRCLE-Seq Press Release|website=beacongenomics.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> CIRCLE-seq aims to remove the drawbacks of Digenome-seq such as the need for a large sample size and read depth (~400 million reads) and the high background that makes identification of low frequency cleavage events harder.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai SQ, Nguyen NT, Malagon-Lopez J, Topkar VV, Aryee MJ, Joung JK | title = CIRCLE-seq: a highly sensitive in vitro screen for genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease off-targets | language = En | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–614 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28459458 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.4278 | pmc = 5924695 }}</ref> It adopts a [[restriction enzyme]] independent strategy to create and select conversion of randomly sheared DNA. On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing. While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available (which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). Nearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side.

=== Barcoded libraries of targets ===
Nucleases such as Cas9 may also be challenged ''in vitro'' by randomized libraries of targets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huston |first1=Nicholas C. |last2=Tycko |first2=Josh |last3=Tillotson |first3=Eric L. |last4=Wilson |first4=Christopher J. |last5=Myer |first5=Vic E. |last6=Jayaram |first6=Hariharan |last7=Steinberg |first7=Barrett E. |title=Identification of Guide-Intrinsic Determinants of Cas9 Specificity |journal=The CRISPR Journal |date=1 June 2019 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=172–185 |doi=10.1089/crispr.2019.0009 |pmid=31225747 |pmc=6694761 |issn=2573-1599|doi-access=free }}</ref> Adapter ligation to quantify cleaved and uncleaved library members allows for unbiased measurement of a nuclease's specificity profile. Measurement of cleavage of barcoded libraries of targets (BLT) with SpCas9 indicated that specificity profiles were guide-specific and depend on the guide sequence as well as the nuclease itself. Unbiased specificity profiles based on each particular Cas9-gRNA complex may then be used to build guide-specific predictive models for ''in vitro'' cleavage.

== Significance ==

=== Gene therapy ===
In order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete. The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern, especially during clinical trials when off-target modifications can block the further development of a candidate product.<ref name=""Gautron_2017"" /> Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of [[B-cell lymphoma]]. To limit the rate of off-target cleavage, the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN, which has proven to have little-to-no background off-target interaction.<ref name=""Gautron_2017"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gautron AS, Juillerat A, Guyot V, Filhol JM, Dessez E, Duclert A, Duchateau P, Poirot L | title = Fine and Predictable Tuning of TALEN Gene Editing Targeting for Improved T Cell Adoptive Immunotherapy | journal = Molecular Therapy: Nucleic Acids | volume = 9 | pages = 312–321 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29246309 | pmc = 5684446 | doi = 10.1016/j.omtn.2017.10.005 }}</ref> CAR-T [[immunotherapy]] is an ''[[ex vivo]]'' procedure, which means that the patient's immune cells (in this case [[T cell|T-cells]]) are extracted and edited using designer nucleases.<ref name=""Gautron_2017"" /> While TALEN system development is expensive and time-consuming, research and engineering modifications have drastically limited their rate of off-target interaction.

=== Gene Drives ===
Engineered gene drives using CRISPR-cas9 are currently being tested and have been proposed as strategies to eliminate invasive species and disease vectors. By genetically modifying an organism to express an endogenous sequence-specific endonuclease,  a target (such as a fertility gene) can be cleaved on the opposite chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Champer J, Buchman A, Akbari OS | title = Cheating evolution: engineering gene drives to manipulate the fate of wild populations | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 146–59 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26875679 | doi = 10.1038/nrg.2015.34 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A DSB at the target leads to homologous repair which effectively renders the organism homozygous for the desired target sequence. This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility. However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely. With every subsequent generation, off-target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic. Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression. In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Webber BL, Raghu S, Edwards OR | title = Opinion: Is CRISPR-based gene drive a biocontrol silver bullet or global conservation threat? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 34 | pages = 10565–7 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26272924 | pmc = 4553820 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1514258112 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Controversy ==
The increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies.

=== Schaefer ''et al.'' 2017 ===
On May 30, 2017, a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNV]]s and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an ''[[in vivo]]'' gene repair experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer KA, Wu WH, Colgan DF, Tsang SH, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB | title = Unexpected mutations after CRISPR-Cas9 editing in vivo | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 547–548 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28557981 | pmc = 5796662 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.4293 }}</ref> The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain (''rd1'') by correcting the Y347X mutation in the ''[[PDE6B|Pde6b]]'' gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WH, Tsai YT, Justus S, Lee TT, Zhang L, Lin CS, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB, Tsang SH | title = CRISPR Repair Reveals Causative Mutation in a Preclinical Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1388–94 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27203441 | pmc = 5023380 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2016.107 }}</ref> After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes.

As with any potentially powerful technique, gene drives can be misused in a variety of ways or induce [[unintended consequences]]. For example, a gene drive intended to affect only a local population might spread across an entire species. Gene drives used to eradicate populations of invasive species in their non-native habitats may have consequences for the population of the species as a whole, even in its native habitat. Any accidental return of individuals of the species to its original habitats, through natural migration, environmental disruption (storms, floods, etc.), accidental human transportation, or purposeful relocation, could unintentionally drive the species to extinction if the relocated individuals carried harmful gene drives.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/story/this-gene-editing-tech-might-be-too-dangerous-to-unleash/ | title = This Gene-Editing Tech Might Be Too Dangerous To Unleash | magazine = Wired }}</ref>

Gene drives can be built from many naturally occurring [[selfish genetic elements]] that use a variety of molecular mechanisms.<ref name="":1""/> These naturally occurring mechanisms induce similar [[segregation distortion]] in the wild, arising when [[allele]]s evolve molecular mechanisms that give them a transmission chance greater than the normal 50%.

Most gene drives have been developed in insects, notably mosquitoes, as a way to control insect-borne pathogens. Recent developments designed gene drives directly in viruses, notably [[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]]. These viral gene drives can propagate a modification into the population of viruses, and aim to reduce the infectivity of the virus.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last1=Walter|first1=Marius|last2=Verdin|first2=Eric|date=2020-09-28|title=Viral gene drive in herpesviruses|url= |journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4884|doi=10.1038/s41467-020-18678-0|pmid=32985507|pmc=7522973|issn=2041-1723}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-30|title=Gene Drives Could Kill Mosquitoes and Suppress Herpesvirus Infections|url=https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/09/30/gene-drives-could-kill-mosquitoes-and-suppress-herpesvirus-infections-15060|access-date=2020-10-07|website=American Council on Science and Health|language=en}}</ref>

== Mechanism ==
In [[Sexual reproduction|sexually-reproducing]] species, most genes are present in two copies (which can be the same or different [[allele]]s), either one of which has a 50% chance of passing to a descendant. By biasing the inheritance of particular altered genes, synthetic gene drives could spread alterations through a population.<ref name=""el14072""/><ref name=""rspb14072""/>

=== Molecular mechanisms ===
[[File:Molecular mechanism of gene drive.svg|alt=Molecular mechanism of gene drive.|thumb|540x540px|Molecular mechanism of gene drive.]]
At the molecular level, an endonuclease gene drive works by cutting a [[chromosome]] at a specific site that does not encode the drive, inducing the cell to [[DNA repair|repair the damage]] by copying the drive sequence onto the damaged chromosome. The cell then has two copies of the drive sequence. The method derives from [[genome editing]] techniques and relies on the fact that double strand breaks are most frequently repaired by [[homologous recombination]], (in the presence of a template), rather than [[non-homologous end joining]]. To achieve this behavior, endonuclease gene drives consist of two nested elements:
* either a [[homing endonuclease]] or a RNA-guided endonuclease (e.g., [[Cas9]] or [[Cas12a]]<ref>""[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2015/10/03/even-crispr Even CRISPR]"". The Economist. ISSN 0013-0613. Retrieved 2016-05-03. Note: Cas12a was previously known as Cpf1. The latter name is used in this 2015 article.</ref>) and its [[guide RNA]], that cuts the target sequence in recipient cells
* a template sequence used by the DNA repair machinery after the target sequence is cut. To achieve the self-propagating nature of gene drives, this repair template contains at least the endonuclease sequence. Because the template must be used to repair a [[double-strand break]] at the cutting site, its sides are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the sequences that are adjacent to the cutting site in the host genome. By targeting the gene drive to a gene coding sequence, this gene will be inactivated; additional sequences can be introduced in the gene drive to encode new functions.
As a result, the gene drive insertion in the genome will re-occur in each organism that inherits one copy of the modification and one copy of the wild-type gene. If the gene drive is already present in the egg cell (e.g. when received from one parent), all the gametes of the individual will carry the gene drive (instead of 50% in the case of a normal gene).<ref name=""el14072""/>

=== Spreading in the population ===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}
Since it can never more than double in frequency with each generation, a gene drive introduced in a single individual typically requires dozens of generations to affect a substantial fraction of a population. Alternatively, releasing drive-containing organisms in sufficient numbers can affect the rest within a few generations; for instance, by introducing it in every thousandth individual, it takes only 12–15 generations to be present in all individuals.<ref name="":22"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Unckless RL, Messer PW, Connallon T, Clark AG | title = Modeling the Manipulation of Natural Populations by the Mutagenic Chain Reaction | journal = Genetics | volume = 201 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–31 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26232409 | pmc = 4596658 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.115.177592 }}</ref> Whether a gene drive will ultimately become fixed in a population and at which speed depends on its effect on individual fitness, on the rate of allele conversion, and on the population structure. In a well mixed population and with realistic allele conversion frequencies (≈90%), population genetics predicts that gene drives get fixed for selection coefficient smaller than 0.3;<ref name="":22"" /> in other words, gene drives can be used to spread modifications as long as reproductive success is not reduced by more than 30%. This is in contrast with normal genes, which can only spread across large populations if they increase fitness.

=== Gene drive in viruses ===
Because the strategy usually relies on the simultaneous presence of an unmodified and a gene drive allele in the same [[cell nucleus]], it had generally been assumed that a gene drive could only be engineered in sexually reproducing organisms, excluding [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. However, during a [[viral infection]], viruses can accumulate hundreds or thousand genome copies in infected cells. Beside, cells are frequently co-infected by multiple virions and [[Homologous recombination|recombination]] between viral genomes is a well-known and widespread source of diversity for many viruses. In particular, [[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]] are nuclear-replicating [[DNA virus]]es with large double-stranded DNA genomes and frequently undergo homologous recombination during their replication cycle.

These properties have enabled the design of a gene drive strategy that doesn't involve sexual reproduction, but relies on [[Coinfection|co-infection]] of a given cell by a naturally occurring and an engineered virus. Upon co-infection, the unmodified genome is cut and repaired by homologous recombination, producing new gene drive viruses that can progressively replace the naturally occurring population. In [[cell culture]] experiments, it was shown that a viral gene drive can spread into the viral population and strongly reduce the infectivity of the virus, which opens novel therapeutic strategies against herpesviruses.<ref name="":2"" />

== Technical limitations ==
Because gene drives propagate by replacing other alleles that contain a cutting site and the corresponding homologies, their application has been mostly limited to sexually reproducing species (because they are [[Ploidy|diploid]] or [[Polyploid#Plants|polyploid]] and alleles are mixed at each generation). As a side effect, inbreeding could in principle be an escape mechanism, but the extent to which this can happen in practice is difficult to evaluate.<ref>{{cite bioRxiv|last=Bull|first=James J. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2016-04-02|title=Lethal Gene Drive Selects Escape through Inbreeding|biorxiv=10.1101/046847}}</ref>

Due to the number of generations required for a gene drive to affect an entire population, the time to universality varies according to the reproductive cycle of each species: it may require under a year for some invertebrates, but centuries for organisms with years-long intervals between birth and [[sexual maturity]], such as humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oye KA, Esvelt K, Appleton E, Catteruccia F, Church G, Kuiken T, Lightfoot SB, McNamara J, Smidler A, Collins JP | display-authors = 6 | title = Biotechnology.

== History ==
Austin Burt, an [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary geneticist]] at [[Imperial College London]], introduced the possibility of conducting gene drives based on natural homing endonuclease [[selfish genetic elements]] in 2003.<ref name=""rspb14072""/>

Researchers had already shown that such genes could [[Gene-centered view of evolution#Selfish-gene theory|act selfishly]] to spread rapidly over successive generations. Burt suggested that gene drives might be used to prevent a mosquito population from transmitting the [[malaria parasite]] or to crash a mosquito population. Gene drives based on homing endonucleases have been demonstrated in the laboratory in [[transgenic]] populations of mosquitoes<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Windbichler N, Menichelli M, Papathanos PA, Thyme SB, Li H, Ulge UY, Hovde BT, Baker D, Monnat RJ, Burt A, Crisanti A | display-authors = 6 | title = A synthetic homing endonuclease-based gene drive system in the human malaria mosquito | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7346 | pages = 212–5 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21508956 | pmc = 3093433 | doi = 10.1038/nature09937 | bibcode = 2011Natur.473..212W }}</ref> and fruit flies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan YS, Naujoks DA, Huen DS, Russell S | title = Insect population control by homing endonuclease-based gene drive: an evaluation in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Genetics | volume = 188 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–44 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21368273 | pmc = 3120159 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.127506 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan YS, Huen DS, Glauert R, Whiteway E, Russell S | title = Optimising homing endonuclease gene drive performance in a semi-refractory species: the Drosophila melanogaster experience | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e54130 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23349805 | pmc = 3548849 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0054130 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...854130C | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, homing endonucleases are sequence-specific.

When the endonuclease cuts the target sequence, the cell repairs the damage by replacing the original sequence with homologous DNA.

Because of CRISPR's targeting flexibility, gene drives could theoretically be used to engineer almost any trait. Unlike previous designs, they could be tailored to block the evolution of drive resistance in the target population by targeting multiple sequences within appropriate genes. CRISPR could permit a variety of gene drive architectures intended to control rather than crash populations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Applications  ==
Gene drives have two main classes of application, which have implications of different significance:

* introduce a genetic modification in laboratory populations; once a strain or a line carrying the gene drive has been produced, the drive can be passed to any other line by mating. Here the gene drive is used to achieve much more easily a task that could be accomplished with other techniques.
* introduce a genetic modification in wild populations. Gene drives constitute a major development that makes possible previously unattainable changes.

Because of their unprecedented potential risk, safeguard mechanisms have been proposed and tested.<ref name="":3"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DiCarlo JE, Chavez A, Dietz SL, Esvelt KM, Church GM | title = Safeguarding CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives in yeast | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 12 | pages = 1250–1255 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26571100 | pmc = 4675690 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3412 }}</ref>

=== Disease vector species ===
One possible application is to genetically modify [[mosquito]]es, [[Mouse|mice]], and other disease vectors so that they cannot transmit diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]] in the case of mosquitoes and [[tick-borne disease]] in the case of mice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buchthal|first=Joanna|last2=Evans|first2=Sam Weiss|last3=Lunshof|first3=Jeantine|last4=Telford|first4=Sam R.|last5=Esvelt|first5=Kevin M.|date=2019-05-13|title=Mice Against Ticks: an experimental community-guided effort to prevent tick-borne disease by altering the shared environment|url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2018.0105|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=374|issue=1772|pages=20180105|doi=10.1098/rstb.2018.0105|pmc=6452264|pmid=30905296}}</ref> Researchers have claimed that by applying the technique to 1% of the wild population of mosquitoes, that they could eradicate malaria within a year.<ref>{{Cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI_OhvOumT0|title=Gene editing can now change an entire species -- forever|date=2016-06-02|last=Kahn|first=Jennifer | name-list-style = vanc |language=en|publisher=TED}}</ref>

Sciences and many others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geneticbiocontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GBIRD-FactSheet-April-2018.pdf | title=GBIRd Fact Sheet | date=1 April 2018 | access-date=14 November 2018 }}</ref> A wider Outreach Network for Gene Drive Research exists to raise awareness of the value of gene drive research for the public good.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://genedrivenetwork.org/resources/6-mission-principles-statement-july2018/file | title=Mission & Principles Statement | date=1 July 2018 | access-date=14 November 2018 }}</ref>

Techniques have been devised to insert, delete, and modify [[DNA]] at multiple levels, ranging from a specific [[base pair]] in a specific [[gene]] to entire genes. 

The ability to genetically engineer organisms is built on years of research and discovery on gene function and manipulation. Important advances included the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, [[DNA ligase]]s, and the development of [[polymerase chain reaction]] and [[sequencing]].

Added genes are often accompanied by [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] regions as well as a [[selectable marker]] gene. The added gene may itself be modified to make it [[Expression (genetics)|express]] more efficiently. This vector is then inserted into the host organism's genome. For animals, the gene is typically inserted into [[embryonic stem cells]], while in plants it can be inserted into any tissue that can be [[Tissue culture|cultured]] into a fully developed plant. 

Tests are carried out on the modified organism to ensure stable integration, [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] and expression. First generation offspring are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]], requiring them to be inbred to create the homozygous pattern necessary for stable inheritance. Homozygosity must be confirmed in second generation specimens.

Early techniques randomly inserted the genes into the genome. Advances allow targeting specific locations, which reduces unintended side effects. Early techniques relied on [[meganuclease]]s and [[zinc finger nuclease]]s. Since 2009 more accurate and easier systems to implement have been developed. [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) and the [[Cas9|Cas9-guideRNA system]] (adapted from [[CRISPR]])  are the two most common.

== History ==
{{see also|History of genetic engineering}}
Many different discoveries and advancements led to the development of [[genetic engineering]]. Human-directed genetic manipulation began with the [[domestication]] of plants and animals through [[artificial selection]] in about 12,000 BC.<ref name=""Root"">{{cite book|title=Domestication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WGDYHvOHwmwC}}|first=Clive |last=Root | name-list-style = vanc |year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Groups|isbn=9780313339875}}</ref>{{rp|1}} Various techniques were developed to aid in breeding and selection.

[[Mendelian inheritance|Genetic inheritance]] was first discovered by [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1865, following experiments crossing peas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartl DL, Orel V | title = What did Gregor Mendel think he discovered? | journal = Genetics | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–53 | date = June 1992 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/131.2.245 | pmid = 1644269 | pmc = 1205000 | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/131/2/245 }}</ref> In 1928 [[Frederick Griffith]] [[Griffith's experiment|proved]] the existence of a ""transforming principle"" involved in inheritance, which was identified as DNA in 1944 by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty]]. [[Frederick Sanger]] developed a method for sequencing DNA in 1977, greatly increasing the genetic information available to researchers.

After discovering the existence and properties of [[DNA]], tools had to be developed that allowed it to be manipulated. In 1970 [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smiths]] lab discovered [[restriction enzymes]], enabling scientists to isolate genes from an organism's genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 5905–8 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15840723 | pmc = 1087929 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500923102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5905R | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[DNA ligase]]s, which join broken DNA together, were discovered earlier in 1967.<ref name=""WeissRichardson1967"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss B, Richardson CC | title = Enzymatic breakage and joining of deoxyribonucleic acid, I.

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, allowed small sections of DNA to be amplified (replicated) and aided identification and isolation of genetic material.

As well as manipulating DNA, techniques had to be developed for its insertion into an organism's genome. Griffith's experiment had already shown that some bacteria had [[natural competence|the ability to naturally uptake and express foreign DNA]]. Artificial competence was induced in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in 1970 by treating them with [[calcium chloride]] solution (CaCl<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandel M, Higa A | title = Calcium-dependent bacteriophage DNA infection | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–62 | date = October 1970 | pmid = 4922220 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90051-3 }}</ref> Transformation using [[electroporation]] was developed in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency and bacterial range.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirth R, Friesenegger A, Fiedler S | title = Transformation of various species of gram-negative bacteria belonging to 11 different genera by electroporation | journal = Molecular & General Genetics | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 175–7 | date = March 1989 | pmid = 2659971 | doi = 10.1007/BF00332248 | s2cid = 25214157 }}</ref> In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', had been discovered.

== Process ==
There are a number of steps that are followed before a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO) is created. Genetic engineers must first choose what [[gene]] they wish to insert, modify, or delete. The gene must then be isolated and incorporated, along with other genetic elements, into a suitable [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]. This vector is then used to insert the gene into the host genome, creating a transgenic or edited organism.

== Choosing target genes ==
The first step is to identify the target gene or genes to insert into the host organism. This is driven by the goal for the resultant organism. In some cases only one or two genes are affected. For more complex objectives entire [[biosynthetic pathway]]s involving multiple genes may be involved. Once found genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification, creating [[genetically modified bacteria]] in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80&nbsp;°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Rediscovering Biology - Online Textbook: Unit 13 Genetically Modified Organisms|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2017-08-18|archive-date=2019-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203123559/http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Genetic screen]]s can be carried out to determine potential genes followed by other tests that identify the best candidates. A simple screen involves randomly [[Mutation|mutating]] DNA with chemicals or radiation and then selecting those that display the desired trait. For organisms where mutation is not practical, scientists instead look for individuals among the population who present the characteristic through naturally-occurring mutations. Processes that look at a [[phenotype]] and then try and identify the gene responsible are called [[forward genetics]]. The gene then needs to be [[Genetic mapping|mapped]] by comparing the inheritance of the phenotype with known [[genetic marker]]s. Genes that are close together are likely to be inherited together.<ref name="":0"">{{cite book |last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce |last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis|first3=Julian |last4=Raff|first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter|first6=Peter | name-list-style = vanc | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | chapter = Studying Gene Expression and Function | chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/ | location = New York | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2002 }}</ref>

Another option is [[reverse genetics]]. This approach involves targeting a specific gene with a mutation and then observing what phenotype develops.<ref name="":0"" /> The mutation can be designed to [[Null allele|inactivate the gene]] or only allow it to become active under certain conditions. [[Conditional mutation]]s are useful for identifying genes that are normally lethal if non-functional.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=Anthony JF |last2=Miller |first2=Jeffrey H. |last3=Suzuki |first3=David T. |last4=Lewontin |first4=Richard C. |last5=Gelbart |first5=William M | name-list-style = vanc |date=2000 | title = An Introduction to Genetic Analysis | edition=   7th | chapter = Mutant types | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22011/ }}</ref> As genes with similar functions share similar sequences ([[Sequence homology|homologous]]) it is possible to predict the likely function of a gene by comparing its sequence to that of well-studied genes from [[model organism]]s.<ref name="":0"" /> The development of [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[transcriptome]]s and [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] has made it much easier to find desirable genes.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jWJ1CgAAQBAJ|page=242}}|title=Current Technologies in Plant Molecular Breeding: A Guide Book of Plant Molecular Breeding for Researchers|last1=Koh|first1=Hee-Jong|last2=Kwon|first2=Suk-Yoon|last3=Thomson|first3=Michael| name-list-style = vanc |date=2015-08-26|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789401799966|page=242}}</ref>

The bacteria ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' was first discovered in 1901 as the causative agent in the death of [[silkworms]]. Due to these insecticidal properties, the bacteria was used as a [[biological insecticide]], developed commercially in 1938. The [[cry protein]]s were discovered to provide the insecticidal activity in 1956, and by the 1980s, scientists had successfully cloned the gene that encodes this protein and expressed it in plants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roh JY, Choi JY, Li MS, Jin BR, Je YH | title = Bacillus thuringiensis as a specific, safe, and effective tool for insect pest control | journal = Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–59 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 18051264 }}</ref>  The gene that provides resistance to the herbicide [[glyphosate]] was found after seven years of searching in bacteria living in the outflow pipe of a [[Monsanto]] [[Glyphosate|RoundUp]] manufacturing facility.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler J | title = The growing menace from superweeds | journal = Scientific American | volume = 304 | issue = 5 | pages = 74–9 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21595408 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0511-74 | bibcode = 2011SciAm.304e..74A }}</ref> In animals, the majority of genes used are [[growth hormone]] genes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The process of genetic modification|author=Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4955e/y4955e06.htm}}</ref>

==Gene manipulation==
All genetic engineering processes involve the modification of DNA. Traditionally DNA was isolated from the cells of organisms. Later, genes came to be [[molecular cloning|cloned]] from a DNA segment after the creation of a [[DNA library]] or [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesised]]. Once isolated, additional genetic elements are added to the gene to allow it to be expressed in the host organism and to aid selection.

=== Extraction from cells ===
{{Main|DNA extraction}}
First the cell must be gently [[Lysis|opened]], exposing the DNA without causing too much damage to it. The methods used vary depending on the type of cell. Once it is open, the DNA must be separated from the other cellular components. A ruptured cell contains proteins and other cell debris. By mixing with [[Phenol–chloroform extraction|phenol and/or chloroform]], followed by [[Centrifuge|centrifuging]], the nucleic acids can be separated from this debris into an upper [[aqueous phase]]. This aqueous phase can be removed and further purified if necessary by repeating the phenol-chloroform steps. The nucleic acids can then be [[precipitated]] from the aqueous solution using [[ethanol]] or [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]]. Any [[RNA]] can be removed by adding a [[ribonuclease]] that will degrade it. Many companies now sell kits that simplify the process.<ref name="":1"">{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g1v6WMHVkTgC}}|title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering | vauthors = Nicholl ST |date=29 May 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-47178-7}}</ref>

=== Gene isolation ===
The gene of interest must be separated from the extracted DNA. If the sequence is not known then a common method is to break the DNA up with a random digestion method. This is usually accomplished using [[restriction enzymes]] (enzymes that cut DNA). A partial [[restriction digest]] cuts only some of the restriction sites, resulting in overlapping DNA fragment segments. The DNA fragments are put into individual [[plasmid|plasmid vectors]] and grown inside bacteria. Once in the bacteria the plasmid is copied as the [[Bacterial growth|bacteria divides]]. To determine if a useful gene is present in a particular fragment, the DNA library is screened for the desired [[phenotype]]. If the phenotype is detected then it is possible that the bacteria contains the target gene.

If the gene does not have a detectable phenotype or a DNA library does not contain the correct gene, other methods must be used to isolate it. If the position of the gene can be determined using [[molecular markers]] then [[chromosome walking]] is one way to isolate the correct DNA fragment. If the gene expresses close [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to a known gene in another species, then it could be isolated by searching for genes in the library that closely match the known gene.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PfJviR3cCtYC|page=85}}|title=Genetic Techniques for Biological Research: A Case Study Approach|last=Michels|first=Corinne A.| name-list-style = vanc |date=10 June 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89919-8|pages=85–88}}</ref>

For known DNA sequences, restriction enzymes that cut the DNA on either side of the gene can be used. [[Gel electrophoresis]] then sorts the fragments according to length.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J |title= Isolating, Cloning, and Sequencing DNA|edition=  4th |location=New York|publisher=Garland Science|year= 2002|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26837/|chapter=8|display-authors= 1}}</ref> Some gels can separate sequences that differ by a single [[Base pair|base-pair]]. The DNA can be visualised by staining it with [[ethidium bromide]] and photographing under [[UV light]]. A [[DNA ladder|marker]] with fragments of known lengths can be laid alongside the DNA to estimate the size of each band. The DNA band at the correct size should contain the gene, where it can be excised from the gel.<ref name="":1"" />{{Rp|40–41}} Another technique to isolate genes of known sequences involves [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufman RI, Nixon BT | title = Use of PCR to isolate genes encoding sigma54-dependent activators from diverse bacteria | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 178 | issue = 13 | pages = 3967–70 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8682806 | pmc = 232662 | doi = 10.1128/jb.178.13.3967-3970.1996 }}</ref> PCR is a powerful tool that can amplify a given sequence, which can then be isolated through gel electrophoresis. Its effectiveness drops with larger genes and it has the potential to introduce errors into the sequence.

It is possible to artificially [[Gene synthesis|synthesise genes]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang J, Luo Y, Zhao H | title = Synthetic biology: putting synthesis into biology | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–20 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21064036| pmc = 3057768 | doi = 10.1002/wsbm.104 }}</ref> Some synthetic sequences are available commercially, forgoing many of these early steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/tw/en/home/life-science/cloning/gene-synthesis/geneart-gene-synthesis.html|title=GeneArt Gene Synthesis|website=www.thermofisher.com |access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref>

=== Modification ===
The gene to be inserted must be combined with other genetic elements in order for it to work properly. The gene can be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. As well as the gene to be inserted most [[DNA construct|constructs]] contain a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region as well as a [[selectable marker]] gene. The promoter region initiates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene and can be used to control the location and level of gene expression, while the terminator region ends transcription. A selectable marker, which in most cases confers [[antibiotic resistance]] to the organism it is expressed in, is used to determine which cells are transformed with the new gene. The constructs are made using [[recombinant DNA]] techniques, such as [[restriction digest]]s, [[DNA ligase|ligations]] and [[molecular cloning]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg P, Mertz JE | title = Personal reflections on the origins and emergence of recombinant DNA technology | journal = Genetics | volume = 184 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–17 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20061565 | pmc = 2815933 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.109.112144 }}</ref>

==Inserting DNA into the host genome==
{{Main|Gene delivery||}}Once the gene is constructed it must be stably integrated into the genome of the target organism or exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. There are a number of techniques available for inserting the gene into the host genome and they vary depending on the type of organism targeted. In multicellular [[eukaryote]]s, if the [[transgene]] is incorporated into the host's [[germline]] cells, the resulting host cell can pass the transgene to its [[Offspring|progeny]]. If the transgene is incorporated into [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells, the transgene can not be inherited.<ref name="":3"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nayerossadat N, Maedeh T, Ali PA | title = Viral and nonviral delivery systems for gene delivery | journal = Advanced Biomedical Research | volume = 1 | pages = 27 | date = 6 July 2012 | pmid = 23210086 | pmc = 3507026 | doi = 10.4103/2277-9175.98152 }}</ref>

=== Transformation ===
{{Main|Transformation (genetics)}}
[[File:Bacterial Transformation.svg|thumb|Bacterial transformation involves moving a gene from one bacteria to another. It is integrated into the recipients plasmid. and can then be expressed by the new host.]]
Transformation is the direct alteration of a cell's genetic components by passing the genetic material through the [[cell membrane]]. About 1% of bacteria are naturally able to [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]], but this ability can be induced in other bacteria.<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen I, Dubnau D | title = DNA uptake during bacterial transformation | journal = Nature Reviews. Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–9 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15083159 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro844 | s2cid = 205499369 }}</ref> Stressing the bacteria with a [[heat shock]] or [[electroporation]] can make the [[cell membrane]] permeable to DNA that may then be incorporated into the genome or exist as extrachromosomal DNA. Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing [[divalent]] [[cation]]s (often [[calcium chloride]]) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse (heat shock). Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA to enter the host cell. It is suggested that exposing the cells to divalent cations in cold condition may change or weaken the cell surface structure, making it more permeable to DNA. The heat-pulse is thought to create a thermal imbalance across the cell membrane, which forces the DNA to enter the cells through either cell pores or the damaged cell wall. [[Electroporation]] is another method of promoting competence.  In this method the cells are briefly shocked with an [[electric field]] of 10-20 [[Volt|kV]]/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter.  After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell's membrane-repair mechanisms. Up-taken DNA can either integrate with the bacterials genome or, more commonly, exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]].

This method can be used on plants that are not susceptible to ''Agrobacterium'' infection and also allows transformation of plant [[plastids]]. Plants cells can also be transformed using electroporation, which uses an electric shock to make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial transformation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

Transformation has a [[Malignant transformation|different meaning]] in relation to animals, indicating progression to a cancerous state, so the process used to insert foreign DNA into animal cells is usually called transfection.<ref name=""Alberts"">{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21052/|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter| name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Garland Science|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8153-4072-0|location=New York|page=G:35 |author-link1=Bruce Alberts}}</ref> There are many ways to directly introduce DNA into animal cells ''[[in vitro]]''.

To create [[transgenic animals]] the DNA must be inserted into viable embryos or eggs. This is usually accomplished using [[microinjection]], where DNA is injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].<ref name=""ReferenceA""/> [[Superovulation|Superovulated]] fertilised eggs are collected at the single cell stage and cultured ''in vitro''. When the [[Pronucleus|pronuclei]] from the sperm head and egg are visible through the [[protoplasm]] the genetic material is injected into one of them.

=== Transduction ===
{{Main|Transduction (genetics)}}

Transduction is the process by which foreign [[DNA]] is introduced into a cell by a [[virus]] or [[viral vector]].<ref>{{MeshName|Transduction, Genetic}}</ref> Genetically modified viruses can be used as [[viral vector]]s to transfer target genes to another organism in [[gene therapy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/pages/2006chapter4.aspx|title=Stemcells Redirection|website=stemcells.nih.gov}}</ref> First the virulent genes are removed from the virus and the target genes are inserted instead. The sequences that allow the virus to insert the genes into the host organism must be left intact. Popular virus vectors are developed from [[retrovirus]]es or [[adenoviruses]]. Other viruses used as vectors include, [[lentivirus]]es, [[pox viruses]] and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes viruses]]. The type of virus used will depend on the cells targeted and whether the DNA is to be altered permanently or temporarily.

=== Regeneration ===
As often only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through the use of [[Plant tissue culture|tissue culture]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuomela M, Stanescu I, Krohn K | title = Validation overview of bio-analytical methods | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 12 Suppl 1 | issue = S1 | pages = S131–8 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16231045 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302627 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-M4lR-pxqJMC|title=Plant Cell and Tissue Culture| vauthors = Narayanaswamy S |date=1994|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780074602775|pages=vi}}</ref> Each plant species has different requirements for successful regeneration.

All offspring from the first generation are [[heterozygous]] for the inserted gene and must be inbred to produce a [[homozygous]] specimen.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally so regeneration is not necessary. [[Selectable markers]] are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells.

Cells that have been successfully transformed with the DNA contain the marker gene, while those not transformed will not. By growing the cells in the presence of an antibiotic or chemical that [[Selection (biology)|selects]] or marks the cells expressing that gene, it is possible to separate modified from unmodified cells. Another screening method involves a [[DNA probe]] that sticks only to the inserted gene. These markers are usually present in the transgenic organism, although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hohn B, Levy AA, Puchta H | title = Elimination of selection markers from transgenic plants | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–43 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11287227 | doi = 10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00188-9 }}</ref>

=== Confirmation ===

Finding that a recombinant organism contains the inserted genes is not usually sufficient to ensure that they will be appropriately expressed in the intended tissues. Further testing using PCR, [[Southern hybridization]], and [[DNA sequencing]] is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGkXFmqOcyIC&q=Genetic+Engineering+analysis+of+DNA+PCR+Southern+sequencing|title=Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods|last=Setlow|first=Jane K.| name-list-style = vanc |date=2002-10-31|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780306472800|pages=109}}</ref> These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene. Once confirmed methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used to assess gene expression, transcription, RNA processing patterns and expression and localization of protein product(s). These include [[northern hybridization|northern hybridisation]], quantitative [[RT-PCR]], [[Western blot]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[ELISA]] and phenotypic analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deepak S, Kottapalli K, Rakwal R, Oros G, Rangappa K, Iwahashi H, Masuo Y, Agrawal G | title = Real-Time PCR: Revolutionizing Detection and Expression Analysis of Genes | journal = Current Genomics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 234–51 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18645596 | pmc = 2430684 | doi = 10.2174/138920207781386960 }}</ref> When appropriate, the organism's offspring are studied to confirm that the transgene and associated [[phenotype]] are stably inherited.

== Gene insertion targeting ==
{{Main|Gene targeting|Genome editing}}

Traditional methods of genetic engineering generally insert the new genetic material randomly within the host genome.  This can impair or alter other genes within the organism. Methods were developed that inserted the new genetic material into [[Locus (genetics)|specific sites]] within an organism genome. Early methods that targeted genes at certain sites within a genome relied on [[homologous recombination]] (HR).<ref>{{cite book|title=Molecular Cell Biology|vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, Matsudaira P, Baltimore D, Darnell J|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7167-3136-8|edition=4th|chapter=Chapter 8.5: Gene Replacement and Transgenic Animals: DNA Is Transferred into Eukaryotic Cells in Various Ways|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/molecularcellbio00lodi}}</ref> By creating DNA constructs that contain a template that matches the targeted genome sequence, it is possible that the HR processes within the cell will insert the construct at the desired location. Using this method on [[embryonic stem cell]]s led to the development of [[transgenic mice]] with targeted [[Gene knockouts|knocked out]]. It has also been possible to [[Gene knock-in|knock in]] genes or alter [[gene expression]] patterns.<ref name="":02"">{{Cite journal|last1=Rocha-Martins|first1=Maurício|last2=Cavalheiro|first2=Gabriel R.|last3=Matos-Rodrigues|first3=Gabriel E.|last4=Martins|first4=Rodrigo a.

If a vital gene is knocked out it can prove lethal to the organism. In order to study the function of these genes, [[Site-specific recombinase technology|site specific recombinases]] (SSR) were used. The two most common types are the [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-LoxP]] and [[FLP-FRT recombination|Flp-FRT]] systems. [[Cre recombinase]] is an enzyme that removes DNA by homologous recombination between binding sequences known as Lox-P sites. The Flip-FRT system operates in a similar way, with the Flip recombinase recognizing FRT sequences. By crossing an organism containing the recombinase sites flanking the gene of interest with an organism that expresses the SSR under control of [[Promoter (genetics)|tissue specific promoters]], it is possible to knock out or switch on genes only in certain cells. This has also been used to remove marker genes from transgenic animals. Further modifications of these systems allowed researchers to induce recombination only under certain conditions, allowing genes to be knocked out or expressed at desired times or [[Prenatal development|stages of development]].<ref name="":02"" />

Genome editing uses artificially engineered [[nuclease]]s that create specific [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]]  at desired locations in the genome. The breaks are subject to cellular [[DNA repair]] processes that can be exploited for targeted gene knock-out, correction or insertion at high frequencies. If a donor DNA containing the appropriate sequence (homologies) is present, then new genetic material containing the transgene will be integrated at the targeted site with high efficiency by [[homologous recombination]].<ref name="":6"" /> There are four families of engineered nucleases: [[meganuclease]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grizot S, Smith J, Daboussi F, Prieto J, Redondo P, Merino N, Villate M, Thomas S, Lemaire L, Montoya G, Blanco FJ, Pâques F, Duchateau P | title = Efficient targeting of a SCID gene by an engineered single-chain homing endonuclease | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 16 | pages = 5405–19 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19584299 | pmc = 2760784 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp548 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao H, Smith J, Yang M, Jones S, Djukanovic V, Nicholson MG, West A, Bidney D, Falco SC, Jantz D, Lyznik LA | title = Heritable targeted mutagenesis in maize using a designed endonuclease | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–87 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19811621 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04041.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend JA, Wright DA, Winfrey RJ, Fu F, Maeder ML, Joung JK, Voytas DF | title = High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 442–5 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404258 | pmc = 2743854 | doi = 10.1038/nature07845 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..442T }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shukla VK, Doyon Y, Miller JC, DeKelver RC, Moehle EA, Worden SE, Mitchell JC, Arnold NL, Gopalan S, Meng X, Choi VM, Rock JM, Wu YY, Katibah GE, Zhifang G, McCaskill D, Simpson MA, Blakeslee B, Greenwalt SA, Butler HJ, Hinkley SJ, Zhang L, Rebar EJ, Gregory PD, Urnov FD | title = Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 437–41 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404259 | doi = 10.1038/nature07992 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..437S | s2cid = 4323298 }}</ref> [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALEN),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Christian M, Cermak T, Doyle EL, Schmidt C, Zhang F, Hummel A, Bogdanove AJ, Voytas DF | title = Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases | journal = Genetics | volume = 186 | issue = 2 | pages = 757–61 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20660643 | pmc = 2942870 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.110.120717 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li T, Huang S, Jiang WZ, Wright D, Spalding MH, Weeks DP, Yang B | title = TAL nucleases (TALNs): hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 359–72 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20699274 | pmc = 3017587 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq704 }}</ref> t[[CRISPR|he CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPRassociated protein (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9)]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Esvelt KM, Wang HH | title = Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 641 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23340847 | pmc = 3564264 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.66 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Tan WS, Carlson DF, Walton MW, Fahrenkrug SC, Hackett PB | chapter = Precision editing of large animal genomes | volume = 80 | pages = 37–97 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23084873 | pmc = 3683964 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-404742-6.00002-8 | isbn = 9780124047426 | series = Advances in Genetics | title = Advances in Genetics Volume 80 }}</ref> Among the four types, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas are the two most commonly used.<ref name=pmid28451378>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s13578-017-0148-4 |pmid=28451378 |pmc=5404292 |title=Plant genome editing with TALEN and CRISPR |journal=Cell & Bioscience |volume=7 |pages=21 |year=2017 |last1=Malzahn |first1=Aimee |last2=Lowder |first2=Levi |last3=Qi |first3=Yiping }}</ref> Recent advances have looked at combining multiple systems to  exploit the best features of both (e.g. megaTAL that are a fusion of a TALE DNA binding domain and a meganuclease).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boissel S, Jarjour J, Astrakhan A, Adey A, Gouble A, Duchateau P, Shendure J, Stoddard BL, Certo MT, Baker D, Scharenberg AM | title = megaTALs: a rare-cleaving nuclease architecture for therapeutic genome engineering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 2591–601 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24285304 | pmc = 3936731 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1224 }}</ref> Recent research has also focused on developing strategies to create gene knock-out or corrections without creating double stranded breaks (base editors).<ref name=pmid28451378/>

=== Meganucleases and Zinc finger nucleases ===
Meganucleases were first used in 1988 in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7882137 |year=1994 |last1=Choulika |first1=A. |title=The yeast I-Sce I meganuclease induces site-directed chromosomal recombination in mammalian cells |journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série III |volume=317 |issue=11 |pages=1013–9 |last2=Perrin |first2=A. |last3=Dujon |first3=B. |last4=Nicolas |first4=J. F. }}</ref> Meganucleases are [[endodeoxyribonucleases]] that function as restriction enzymes with long recognition sites, making them more specific to their target site than other [[restriction enzyme]]s. This increases their specificity and reduces their toxicity as they will not target as many sites within a genome. The most studied meganucleases are the [[Homing endonuclease#Structural families|LAGLIDADG family]]. While meganucleases are still quite susceptible to off-target binding, which makes them less attractive than other gene editing tools, their smaller size still makes them attractive particularly for viral vectorization perspectives.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":6"" />

Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), used for the first time in 1996, are typically created through the fusion of Zinc-finger domains and the ''Fok''I nuclease domain. ZFNs have thus the ability to cleave DNA at target sites.<ref name="":6"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll D | title = Genome engineering with zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Genetics | volume = 188 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–82 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21828278 | pmc = 3176093 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.131433 }}</ref> By engineering the zinc finger domain to target a specific site within the genome, it is possible to edit the genomic sequence at the desired [[Locus (genetics)|location]].<ref name="":4"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva G, Poirot L, Galetto R, Smith J, Montoya G, Duchateau P, Pâques F | title = Meganucleases and other tools for targeted genome engineering: perspectives and challenges for gene therapy | journal = Current Gene Therapy | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–27 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21182466 | pmc = 3267165 | doi = 10.2174/156652311794520111 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva GH, Belfort M, Wende W, Pingoud A | title = From monomeric to homodimeric endonucleases and back: engineering novel specificity of LAGLIDADG enzymes | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 361 | issue = 4 | pages = 744–54 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16872628 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.063 }}</ref><ref name="":6"" /> ZFNs have a greater specificity, but still hold the potential to bind to non-specific sequences.. While a certain amount of off-target cleavage is acceptable for creating transgenic model organisms, they might not be optimal for all human gene therapy treatments.<ref name="":4"" />

=== TALEN and CRISPR ===
Access to the code governing the DNA recognition by transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) in 2009 opened the way to the development of a new class of efficient TAL-based gene editing tools. TALE, proteins secreted by the Xanthomonas plant pathogen, bind with great specificity to genes within the plant host and initiate [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]  of the genes helping infection. Engineering TALE by fusing the DNA binding core to the [[Fok1 nuclease|''Fok''I nuclease]] catalytic domain allowed creation of a new tool of designer nucleases, the TALE nuclease (TALEN).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.120717 |pmid=20660643 |pmc=2942870 |title=Targeting DNA Double-Strand Breaks with TAL Effector Nucleases |journal=Genetics |volume=186 |issue=2 |pages=757–761 |year=2010 |last1=Christian |first1=M. |last2=Cermak |first2=T. |last3=Doyle |first3=E.

F. }}</ref> They have one of the greatest specificities of all the current engineered nucleases. Due to the presence of repeat sequences, they are difficult to construct through standard molecular biology procedure and rely on more complicated method of such as [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden gate cloning]].<ref name=pmid28451378/>

In 2011, another major breakthrough technology was developed based on CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat / CRISPR associated protein) systems that function as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and [[archaea]].  The CRISPR/Cas system allows bacteria and archaea to fight against invading viruses by cleaving viral DNA and inserting pieces of that DNA into their own genome. The organism then transcribes this DNA into [[RNA]] and combines this RNA with [[Cas9]] proteins to make double-stranded breaks in the invading viral DNA. The RNA serves as a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to the correct spot in the virus DNA. By pairing Cas proteins with a designed guide RNA CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to induce double-stranded breaks at specific points within DNA sequences. The break gets repaired by cellular DNA repair enzymes, creating a small insertion/deletion type mutation in most cases. Targeted DNA repair is possible by providing a donor DNA template that represents the desired change and that is (sometimes) used for double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. It was later demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 can edit human cells in a dish. Although the early generation lacks the specificity of TALEN, the major advantage of this technology is the simplicity of the design. It also allows multiple sites to be targeted simultaneously, allowing the editing of multiple genes at once. [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] is a more recently discovered system that requires a different guide RNA to create particular double-stranded breaks (leaves overhangs when cleaving the DNA) when compared to CRISPR/Cas9.<ref name=pmid28451378/>

CRISPR/Cas9 is efficient at gene disruption. The creation of HIV-resistant babies by Chinese researcher He Jiankui is perhaps the most famous example of gene disruption using this method.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What's next for CRISPR babies? |journal=Nature |volume=566 |pages=440–442 |year=2019 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=D. |issue=7745 |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00673-1 |doi-access=free |pmid=30809070 }}</ref> It is far less effective at gene correction. Methods of base editing are under development in which a “nuclease-dead” Cas 9 endonuclease or a related enzyme is used for gene targeting while a linked deaminase enzyme makes a targeted base change in the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Base editing: precision chemistry on the genome and transcriptome of living cells. |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=770–788 |year=2018 |last1=Rees |first1=H. |last2=Liu |first2=D.

This method links a reverse transcriptase to an RNA-guided engineered nuclease that only makes single-strand cuts but no double-strand breaks. It replaces the portion of DNA next to the cut by the successive action of nuclease and reverse transcriptase, introducing the desired change from an RNA template.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1711-4 |title=Search-and-replace genome editing without double strand breaks or donor DNA. |journal=Nature |volume=576|issue=7785 |pages=149–157|year=2019 |last1=Anzalone |first1=A.

25,Gene knockdown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown,"'''Gene knockdown''' is an experimental technique by which the [[Gene expression|expression]] of one or more of an [[organism]]'s [[gene]]s is reduced. The reduction can occur either through [[genetic modification]] or by treatment with a [[reagent]] such as a short DNA or RNA [[oligonucleotide]] that has a sequence complementary to either gene or an mRNA transcript.<ref name=""Comparison"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Summerton JE | s2cid = 12241724 | title = Morpholino, siRNA, and S-DNA compared: impact of structure and mechanism of action on off-target effects and sequence specificity | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 651–60 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17430206 | doi = 10.2174/156802607780487740 }}</ref>

==Versus transient knockdown==

If a [[DNA]] of an organism is genetically modified, the resulting organism is called a ""knockdown organism."" If the change in [[gene expression]] is caused by an [[oligonucleotide]] binding to an [[mRNA]] or temporarily binding to a [[gene]], this leads to a temporary change in gene expression that does not modify the chromosomal DNA, and the result is referred to as a ""transient knockdown"".<ref name=""Comparison""/>

In a transient knockdown, the binding of this oligonucleotide to the active gene or its transcripts causes decreased expression through a variety of processes. Binding can occur either through the blocking of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] (in the case of gene-binding), the degradation of the [[mRNA]] transcript (e.g. by small interfering RNA ([[siRNA]])) or [[RNase]]-H dependent antisense, or through the blocking of either [[mRNA]] [[Translation (biology)|translation]], pre-m[[RNA splicing]] sites, or [[nuclease]] cleavage sites used for maturation of other functional RNAs, including [[miRNA]] (e.g. by [[morpholino]] oligos or other RNase-H independent antisense).<ref name=""Comparison"" /><ref name=""RNaseH"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Summerton J | title = Morpholino antisense oligomers: the case for an RNase H-independent structural type | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression | volume = 1489 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–58 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10807004 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-4781(99)00150-5 }}</ref>

The most direct use of transient knockdowns is for learning about a [[gene]] that has been [[sequenced]], but has an unknown or incompletely known function. This experimental approach is known as [[reverse genetics]]. Researchers draw inferences from how the knockdown differs from individuals in which the gene of interest is operational. Transient knockdowns are often used in [[developmental biology]] because oligos can be injected into single-celled [[zygote]]s and will be present in the daughter cells of the injected cell through [[embryo]]nic development.<ref name=""Comparison3"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nasevicius A, Ekker SC | title = Effective targeted gene 'knockdown' in zebrafish | journal = [[Nature Genetics]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–20 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11017081 | doi = 10.1038/79951 | s2cid = 21451111 }}</ref> The term gene knockdown first appeared in the literature in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wahlestedt |first1=Claes |title=Antisense oligonucleotide strategies in neuropharmacology |journal=Trends Pharmacol Sci |date=February 1994 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=42–6 |doi=10.1016/0165-6147(94)90107-4|pmid=8165722 }}</ref>

Small interfering RNAs can originate from inside the cell or can be exogenously introduced into the cell. Once introduced into the cell, exogenous siRNAs are processed by the RNA-induced silencing complex ([[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC]]).<ref name=""RISC"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pratt AJ, MacRae IJ | title = The RNA-induced silencing complex: a versatile gene-silencing machine | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 27 | pages = 17897–901 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19342379 | pmc = 2709356 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R900012200 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The siRNA is complementary to the target mRNA to be silenced, and the RISC uses the siRNA as a template for locating the target mRNA. After the RISC localizes to the target mRNA, the RNA is cleaved by a ribonuclease.

RNAi is widely used as a laboratory technique for genetic functional analysis.<ref name=""functional analysis"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser AG, Kamath RS, Zipperlen P, Martinez-Campos M, Sohrmann M, Ahringer J | title = Functional genomic analysis of C. elegans chromosome I by systematic RNA interference | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6810 | pages = 325–30 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11099033 | doi = 10.1038/35042517 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..325F | s2cid = 4373444 }}</ref> RNAi in organisms such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and ''[[Drosophila|Drosophila melanogaster]]'' provides a quick and inexpensive means of investigating gene function.

==CRISPRs==
{{off topic|date=April 2020}}
A different means of silencing exogenous DNA that has been discovered in [[prokaryotes]] is a mechanism involving loci called 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', or [[CRISPR]]s.<ref name=""CRISPR review"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Larson MH, Morsut L, Liu Z, Brar GA, Torres SE, Stern-Ginossar N, Brandman O, Whitehead EH, Doudna JA, Lim WA, Weissman JS, Qi LS | title = CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 442–51 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23849981 | pmc = 3770145 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.044 }}</ref> CRISPR-associated (cas) genes encode cellular machinery that cuts exogenous DNA into small fragments and inserts them into a CRISPR repeat locus. When this CRISPR region of DNA is expressed by the cell, the small RNAs produced from the exogenous DNA inserts serve as a template sequence that other Cas proteins use to silence this same exogenous sequence. The transcripts of the short exogenous sequences are used as a guide to silence these foreign DNA when they are present in the cell. This serves as a kind of acquired immunity, and this process is like a prokaryotic RNA interference mechanism.

==TALENs==

Another technology made possible by prokaryotic genome manipulation is the use of transcription activator-like effector nucleases ([[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]]) to target specific genes.<ref name=""TALEN paper"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun N, Zhao H | title = Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs): a highly efficient and versatile tool for genome editing | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 110 | issue = 7 | pages = 1811–21 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23508559 | doi = 10.1002/bit.24890 | s2cid = 6214542 }}</ref> TALENs are nucleases that have two important functional components: a DNA binding domain and a DNA cleaving domain. The DNA binding domain is a sequence-specific transcription activator-like effector sequence while the DNA cleaving domain originates from a bacterial endonuclease and is non-specific. TALENs can be designed to cleave a sequence specified by the sequence of the transcription activator-like effector portion of the construct. Once designed, a TALEN is introduced into a cell as a plasmid or mRNA. The TALEN is expressed, localizes to its target sequence, and cleaves a specific site. After cleavage of the target DNA sequence by the TALEN, the cell uses non-homologous end joining as a DNA repair mechanism to correct the cleavage. The cell's attempt at repairing the cleaved sequence can render the encoded protein non-functional, as this repair mechanism introduces insertion or deletion errors at the repaired site.

==Commercialization==

So far, knockdown organisms with permanent alterations in their DNA have been engineered chiefly for research purposes. Also known simply as '''knockdowns''', these organisms are most commonly used for reverse genetics, especially in species such as [[mice]] or [[rat]]s for which transient knockdown technologies cannot easily be applied.<ref name=""Comparison3"" /><ref name=""SB"">{{cite web|url=http://www.sirion-biotech.com/adenoviral_gene_knockdown.html|title=Adenoviral Gene Knockdown Cells|publisher=Sirion Biotech|access-date=17 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709092500/http://www.sirion-biotech.com/adenoviral_gene_knockdown.html|archive-date=9 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A '''germline mutation''', or '''germinal mutation''', is any detectable variation within [[germ cell]]s (cells that, when fully developed, become [[sperm]] and [[Egg cell|ova]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46384|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2017-11-30|date=2011-02-02}}</ref> Mutations in these cells are the only mutations that can be passed on to offspring, when either a mutated [[sperm]] or [[oocyte]] come together to form a [[zygote]].<ref name=""Griffiths 2000"">{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Anthony JF|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Suzuki|first3=David T.|last4=Lewontin|first4=Richard C.|last5=Gelbart|first5=William M. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2000|title=Somatic versus germinal mutation|journal=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis|edition=7th|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21894/}}</ref> After this fertilization event occurs, germ cells divide rapidly to produce all of the cells in the body, causing this mutation to be present in every [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] and germline cell in the offspring; this is also known as a constitutional mutation.<ref name=""Griffiths 2000""/> Germline mutation is distinct from [[somatic mutation]].

== When mutagenesis occurs ==
Germline mutations can occur before fertilization and during various stages of zygote development.<ref name="":0"" /> When the mutation arises will determine the effect it has on offspring. If the mutation arises in either the sperm or the oocyte before development, then the mutation will be present in every cell in the individual's body.<ref name="":9"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Samuels ME, Friedman JM | title = Genetic mosaics and the germ line lineage | journal = Genes | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–37 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25898403 | doi = 10.3390/genes6020216 | pmc=4488662| doi-access = free }}</ref> A mutation that arises soon after fertilization, but before germline and somatic cells are determined, then the mutation will be present in a large proportion of the individual's cell with no bias towards germline or somatic cells, this is also called a gonosomal mutation.<ref name="":9"" /> A mutation that arises later in zygote development will be present in a small subset of either somatic or germline cells, but not both.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":9"" />

== Causes ==

=== Endogenous factors ===
A germline mutation often arises due to [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] factors, like errors in cellular replication and oxidative damage.<ref name="":1"" /> This damage is rarely repaired imperfectly, but due to the high rate of germ cell division, can occur frequently.<ref name="":1"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crow JF | title = The origins, patterns and implications of human spontaneous mutation | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–7 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11262873 | doi = 10.1038/35049558 | s2cid = 22279735 }}</ref>

Endogenous mutations are more prominent in sperm than in ova.<ref name="":2"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong WS, Solomon BD, Bodian DL, Kothiyal P, Eley G, Huddleston KC, Baker R, Thach DC, Iyer RK, Vockley JG, Niederhuber JE | title = New observations on maternal age effect on germline de novo mutations | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 10486 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26781218 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms10486 | pmc=4735694| bibcode = 2016NatCo...710486W }}</ref> This is because [[spermatocyte]]s go through a larger number of cell divisions throughout a male’s life, resulting in more replication cycles that could result in a DNA mutation.<ref name="":1"" /> Errors in maternal ovum also occur, but at a lower rate than in paternal sperm.<ref name="":1"" /> The types of mutations that occur also tend to vary between the sexes.<ref name="":12"" /> A mother's eggs, after production, remain in stasis until each is utilized in ovulation. This long stasis period has been shown to result in a higher number of chromosomal and large sequence deletions, duplications, insertions, and transversions.<ref name="":12"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hassold T, Hunt P | title = Maternal age and chromosomally abnormal pregnancies: what we know and what we wish we knew | journal = Current Opinion in Pediatrics | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–8 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19881348 | pmc = 2894811 | doi = 10.1097/MOP.0b013e328332c6ab }}</ref> The father’s sperm, on the other hand, undergoes continuous replication throughout his lifetime, resulting in many small point mutations that result from errors in replication. These mutations commonly include single base pair substitutions, deletions, and insertions.<ref name="":2"" />

Oxidative damage is another endogenous factor that can cause germline mutations. This type of damage is caused by [[reactive oxygen species]] that build up in the cell as a by-product of [[cellular respiration]].<ref name="":13"" /> These reactive oxygen species are missing an electron, and because they are highly [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] (have a strong electron pull) they will rip an electron away from another molecule.<ref name="":13"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Q, Vazquez EJ, Moghaddas S, Hoppel CL, Lesnefsky EJ | title = Production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria: central role of complex III | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 38 | pages = 36027–31 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12840017 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M304854200 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This can initiate DNA damage because it causes the nucleic acid guanine to shift to 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This 8-oxoG molecule is then mistaken for a thymine by [[DNA polymerase]] during replication, causing a G>T [[transversion]] on one DNA strand, and a C>A transversion on the other.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohno M, Sakumi K, Fukumura R, Furuichi M, Iwasaki Y, Hokama M, Ikemura T, Tsuzuki T, Gondo Y, Nakabeppu Y | title = 8-oxoguanine causes spontaneous de novo germline mutations in mice | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 4 | pages = 4689 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24732879 | pmc = 3986730 | doi = 10.1038/srep04689 | bibcode = 2014NatSR...4E4689O }}</ref>

=== Exogenous factors ===
A germline mutation can also occur due to [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors. Similar to somatic mutations, germline mutations can be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which damage the DNA of germ cells. This damage can then either be repaired perfectly, and no mutations will be present, or repaired imperfectly, resulting in a variety of mutations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_20|title=The causes of mutations|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Exogenous [[mutagen]]s include harmful chemicals and [[ionizing radiation]]; the major difference between germline mutations and somatic mutations is that germ cells are not exposed to [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]], and thus not often directly mutated in this manner.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahbari R, Wuster A, Lindsay SJ, Hardwick RJ, Alexandrov LB, Turki SA, Dominiczak A, Morris A, Porteous D, Smith B, Stratton MR, Hurles ME | title = Timing, rates and spectra of human germline mutation | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–133 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26656846 | pmc = 4731925 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3469 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cai L, Wang P | title = Induction of a cytogenetic adaptive response in germ cells of irradiated mice with very low-dose rate of chronic gamma-irradiation and its biological influence on radiation-induced DNA or chromosomal damage and cell killing in their male offspring | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–100 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7603336 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/10.2.95 }}</ref>

== Clinical implications ==
Different germline mutations can affect an individual differently depending on the rest of their genome. A [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant mutation]] only requires 1 mutated gene to produce the disease [[phenotype]], while a recessive mutation requires both [[allele]]s to be mutated to produce the disease phenotype.<ref name="":11"">{{cite web|url=http://genetics.thetech.org/about-genetics/mutations-and-disease|title=Mutations and Disease {{!}} Understanding Genetics|website=genetics.thetech.org|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> For example, if the embryo inherits an already mutated allele from the father, and the same allele from the mother underwent an endogenous mutation, then the child will display the disease related to that mutated gene, even though only 1 parent carries the mutant allele.<ref name="":11"" /> This is only one example of how a child can display a recessive disease while a mutant gene is only carried by one parent.<ref name="":11"" /> Detection of chromosomal abnormalities can be found in utero for certain diseases by means of blood samples or ultrasound, as well as invasive procedures such as an [[amniocentesis]]. Later detection can be found by genome screening. 

=== Cancer ===
Mutations in [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor genes]] or [[proto-oncogenes]] can predispose an individual to developing tumours.<ref name="":10"">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/cancer-basics/genetics/genetics-cancer|title=The Genetics of Cancer|date=2012-03-26|work=Cancer.Net|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> It is estimated that inherited genetic mutations are involved in 5-10% of cancers. <ref name=""genetics"">{{cite web |title=The Genetics of Cancer |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics |website=National Cancer Institute |publisher=NIH |access-date=23 September 2018|date=2015-04-22 }}</ref> These mutations make a person susceptible to tumour development if the other copy of the [[oncogene]] is randomly mutated. These mutations can occur in germ cells, allowing them to be [[Heritability|heritable]].<ref name="":10"" /> Individuals who inherit germline mutations in [[TP53]] are predisposed to certain cancer variants because the protein produced by this gene suppresses tumors. Patients with this mutation are also at a risk for [[Li–Fraumeni syndrome]].<ref name=""genetics"" />  Other examples include mutations in the [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] genes which predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, or mutations in [[MLH1]] which predispose to [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer|hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer]].

=== Huntington's disease ===
[[Huntington's disease]] is an [[autosomal dominant]] mutation in the HTT gene. The disorder causes degradation in the brain, resulting in uncontrollable movements and behavior.<ref name="":14"">{{cite web |title=Huntington disease |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease |website=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=NIH |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref> The mutation involves an expansion of repeats in the Huntington protein, causing it to increase in size. Patients who have more than 40 repeats will most likely be affected. The onset of the disease is determined by the amount of repeats present in the mutation; the greater the number of repeats, the earlier symptoms of the disease will appear.<ref name="":14"" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Huntington's Disease|last=Lawrence|first=David M.|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9780791095867|location=New York|pages=92}}</ref> Because of the dominant nature of the mutation, only one mutated allele is needed for the disease to be in effect. This means that if one parent is infected, the child will have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.<ref name="":15"">{{cite web |title=Huntington's disease |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117 |website=Mayo Clinic |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref> This disease does not have carriers because if a patient has one mutation, they will (most likely) be affected. The disease typically has a late onset, so many parents have children before they know they have the mutation. The HTT mutation can be detected through [[Genetic testing|genome screening]].

=== Trisomy 21 ===
Trisomy 21 (also known as [[Down syndrome]]) results from a child having 3 copies of chromosome 21.<ref name="":3"" /> This chromosome duplication occurs during germ cell formation, when both copies of chromosome 21 end up in the same [[Cell division|daughter cell]] in either the mother or father, and this mutant germ cell participates in fertilization of the zygote.<ref name="":3"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandley AC | title = On the parental origin of de novo mutation in man | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 217–23 | date = April 1991 | pmid = 1677423 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.28.4.217 | pmc=1016821}}</ref> Another, more common way this can occur is during the first cell division event after the formation of the zygote.<ref name="":3"" /> The risk of Trisomy 21 increases with maternal age with the risk being 1/2000 (0.05%) at age 20 increasing to 1/100 (1%) at age 40.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hook |first1=EB |title=Rates of chromosome abnormalities at different maternal ages |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology | date = September 1981 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=282–5 |doi=10.1016/0091-2182(82)90145-8 |pmid=6455611 }}</ref> This disease can be detected by non-invasive as well as invasive procedures prenatally. Non-invasive procedures include scanning for [[fetal DNA]] through maternal plasma via a blood sample.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ghanta |first1=Sujana |title=Non-Invasive Prenatal Detection of Trisomy 21 Using Tandem Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms |journal=PLOS ONE | date = October 2010 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13184 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013184 |pmid=20949031 |pmc=2951898 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...513184G |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
Cystic fibrosis is an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] disorder that causes a variety of symptoms and complications, the most common of which is a thick mucus lining in lung [[Epithelium|epithelial]] tissue due to improper salt exchange, but can also affect the [[pancreas]], [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]], [[liver]], and [[kidney]]s.<ref name="":4"">{{cite web|url=http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/about-cf|title=Cystic Fibrosis Canada|website=www.cysticfibrosis.ca|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan BP, Freedman SD | title = Cystic fibrosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9678 | pages = 1891–904 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19403164 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60327-5 | s2cid = 46011502 }}</ref> Many bodily processes can be affected due to the hereditary nature of this disease; if the disease is present in the DNA of both the sperm and the egg, then it will be present in essentially every cell and organ in the body; these mutations can occur initially in the germline cells, or be present in all parental cells.<ref name="":4"" /> The most common mutation seen in this disease is ΔF508, which means a deletion of the amino acid at the 508 position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR#conditions|title=CFTR gene|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> If both parents have a mutated [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]] (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein, then their children have a 25% of inheriting the disease.<ref name="":4"" /> If a child has 1 mutated copy of CFTR, they will not develop the disease, but will become a carrier of the disease.<ref name="":4"" /> The mutation can be detected before birth through amniocentesis, or after birth via prenatal genetic screening. <ref name="":16"">{{cite web |title=Prenatal Diagnosis |url=https://www.hopkinscf.org/what-is-cf/diagnosis/presentations/prenatal-diagnosis/ |website=Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref>

== Current therapies ==
Many Mendelian disorders stem from [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] point mutations within genes, including [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Thalassemia|beta-thalassemia]], [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]], and [[Tay–Sachs disease]].<ref name="":11""/> By inducing a double stranded break in sequences surrounding the disease-causing point mutation, a dividing cell can use the non-mutated strand as a template to repair the newly broken DNA strand, getting rid of the disease-causing mutation.<ref name="":6"" /> Many different genome editing techniques have been used for genome editing, and especially germline mutation editing in germ cells and developing zygotes; however, while these therapies have been extensively studied, their use in human germline editing is limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geneticsandsociety.org/internal-content/about-human-germline-gene-editing|title=About Human Germline Gene Editing {{!}} Center for Genetics and Society|website=www.geneticsandsociety.org|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>

=== CRISPR/Cas9 editing ===
[[File:DNA Repair after CRISPR-Cas9 cut.svg|thumb|254x254px|The CRISPR editing system is able to target specific DNA sequences and, using a donor DNA template, can repair mutations within this gene.]]
This editing system induces a double stranded break in the DNA, using a guide RNA and effector protein Cas9 to break the DNA backbones at specific target sequences.<ref name="":6"" /> This system has shown a higher specificity than TALENs or ZFNs due to the Cas9 protein containing homologous (complementary) sequences to the sections of DNA surrounding the site to be cleaved.<ref name="":6"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sander JD, Joung JK | title = CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–55 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24584096 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2842 | pmc=4022601}}</ref>&nbsp;This broken strand can be repaired in 2 main ways: homologous directed repair (HDR) if a DNA strand is present to be used as a template (either homologous or donor), and if one is not, then the sequence will undergo [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ).<ref name="":6"" /> NHEJ often results in insertions or deletions within the gene of interest, due to the processing of the blunt strand ends, and is a way to study gene knockouts in a lab setting.<ref name="":5"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelson T, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–87 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | pmc=4089965| bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}</ref> This method can be used to repair a point mutation by using the [[Chromatid|sister chromosome]] as a template, or by providing a double stranded DNA template with the [[CRISPR]]/Cas9 machinery to be used as the repair template.<ref name="":6"" />

This method has been used in both human and animal models (''[[Drosophila]]'', ''[[House mouse|Mus musculus]]'', ''and [[Arabidopsis]]''), and current research is being focused on making this system more specific to minimize off-target cleavage sites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith C, Gore A, Yan W, Abalde-Atristain L, Li Z, He C, Wang Y, Brodsky RA, Zhang K, Cheng L, Ye Z | title = Whole-genome sequencing analysis reveals high specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN-based genome editing in human iPSCs | language = en | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–3 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24996165 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2014.06.011 | pmc=4338993}}</ref>

=== TALEN editing ===
The [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]] (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) genome editing system is used to induce a double-stranded DNA break at a specific locus in the genome, which can then be used to mutate or repair the DNA sequence.<ref name="":7"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bedell VM, Wang Y, Campbell JM, Poshusta TL, Starker CG, Krug RG, Tan W, Penheiter SG, Ma AC, Leung AY, Fahrenkrug SC, Carlson DF, Voytas DF, Clark KJ, Essner JJ, Ekker SC | title = In vivo genome editing using a high-efficiency TALEN system | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7422 | pages = 114–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23000899 | doi = 10.1038/nature11537 | pmc=3491146| bibcode = 2012Natur.491..114B }}</ref> It functions by using a specific repeated sequence of an amino acid that is 33-34 amino acids in length.<ref name="":7"" /> The specificity of the DNA binding site is determined by the specific amino acids at positions 12 and 13 (also called the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD)) of this tandem repeat, with some RVDs showing a higher specificity for specific amino acids over others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nemudryi AA, Valetdinova KR, Medvedev SP, Zakian SM | title = TALEN and CRISPR/Cas Genome Editing Systems: Tools of Discovery | journal = Acta Naturae | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 19–40 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25349712 | pmc = 4207558 | doi = 10.32607/20758251-2014-6-3-19-40 }}</ref> Once the DNA break is initiated, the ends can either be joined with NHEJ that induces mutations, or by HDR that can fix mutations.<ref name="":6"" />

=== ZFN editing ===
Similar to TALENs, [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs) are used to create a double stranded break in the DNA at a specific locus in the genome.<ref name="":7"" /> The ZFN editing complex consists of a [[Zinc finger|zinc finger protein]] (ZFP) and a restriction enzyme cleavage domain.<ref name="":8"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urnov FD, Rebar EJ, Holmes MC, Zhang HS, Gregory PD | title = Genome editing with engineered zinc finger nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 636–46 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20717154 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2842 | s2cid = 205484701 }}</ref> The ZNP domain can be altered to change the DNA sequence that the [[restriction enzyme]] cuts, and this cleavage event initiates cellular repair processes, similar to that of CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing.<ref name="":8"" />

Compared to CRISPR/Cas9, the therapeutic applications of this technology are limited, due to the extensive engineering required to make each ZFN specific to the desired sequence.<ref name="":8"" />

==Research==
The research interests of Šikšnys include structure-function relationships of [[enzyme]]s involved in [[nucleic acid]]s metabolism. Šikšnys and members of his laboratory perform biochemical, biophysical and structural studies of proteins involved in [[bacteria]]l antiviral defense, including [[restriction endonucleases]] and [[CRISPR|CRISPR-Cas]] systems. Šikšnys has co-authored more than 90 scientific publications and filled 5 patent applications.
For more than two decades Šikšnys’ lab was focused on [[restriction endonucleases]]. Together with colleagues from [[UK]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]] and other countries, Šikšnys has performed biochemical studies of more than 20 [[restriction endonucleases]], and solved approximately one third (~15 out of ~50) of currently available [[restriction endonuclease]] tertiary structures, some of them in collaboration with the [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Robert Huber]].

===Publication of CRISPR-Cas===
Since 2007 Šikšnys focused on mechanistic studies of [[CRISPR|CRISPR-Cas]], the newly discovered bacterial antiviral systems, and was among the first to demonstrate programmable DNA cleavage by the [[Cas9]] protein.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.wired.com/2015/10/battle-genome-editing-gets-science-wrong/ |title=The Battle Over Genome Editing Gets Science All Wrong |last1=Sarah Zhang |magazine=Wired |date=4 October 2015 |publisher=wired.com |access-date=19 January 2015 }}</ref><ref name=""Lander 2016 pp. 18–28"">{{cite journal | last=Lander | first=Eric S. | title=The Heroes of CRISPR | journal=Cell | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=164 | issue=1–2 | year=2016 | issn=0092-8674 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.041 | pages=18–28| pmid=26771483 | s2cid=14638685 }}</ref><ref name=""Gasiunas Barrangou Horvath Siksnys pp. E2579–E2586"">{{cite journal | last1=Gasiunas | first1=G. | last2=Barrangou | first2=R. | last3=Horvath | first3=P. | last4=Siksnys | first4=V. | title=Cas9-crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex mediates specific DNA cleavage for adaptive immunity in bacteria | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=109 | issue=39 | date=4 September 2012 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1208507109 | pages=E2579–E2586| pmid=22949671 | pmc=3465414 | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Science Rewards Eureka Moments, Except When It Doesn't|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/11/02/500331130/science-rewards-eureka-moments-except-when-it-doesnt|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref> According to Šikšnys, his article was not even considered as serious by the editor board of the academic journal and was not sent to the reviewers, therefore the time needed to be recognized as first was lost.<ref>{{Cite episode

'''Functional genomics''' is a field of [[molecular biology]] that attempts to describe [[gene]] (and [[protein]]) functions and interactions. Functional genomics make use of the vast data generated by [[genomics|genomic]] and [[Transcriptomics|transcriptomic]] projects (such as [[genome project|genome sequencing projects]] and [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]]).  Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], [[regulation of gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as [[DNA sequence]] or structures. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional ""gene-by-gene"" approach.

==Definition and goals of functional genomics==

In order to understand functional genomics it is important to first define function. In their paper<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graur D, Zheng Y, Price N, Azevedo RB, Zufall RA, Elhaik E | title = On the immortality of television sets: ""function"" in the human genome according to the evolution-free gospel of ENCODE | journal = Genome Biology and Evolution | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 578–90 | date = 20 February 2013 | pmid = 23431001 | doi = 10.1093/gbe/evt028 | pmc=3622293}}</ref> Graur et al. define function in two possible ways. These are ""selected effect"" and ""causal role"". The ""selected effect"" function refers to the function for which a trait (DNA, RNA, protein etc.) is selected for. The ""causal role"" function refers to the function that a trait is sufficient and necessary for. Functional genomics usually tests the ""causal role"" definition of function.

The goal of functional genomics is to understand the function of genes or proteins, eventually all components of a genome. The term functional genomics is often used to refer to the many '''technical approaches''' to study an organism's '''genes and proteins''', including the ""biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product""<ref name=""Gibson and Muse"">{{cite book |vauthors=Gibson G, Muse SV |title=A primer of genome science |edition=3rd |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, MA}}</ref> while some authors include the study of '''nongenic elements''' in their definition.<ref name=""Pevsner"">{{cite book | vauthors = Pevsner J |year=2009 |title=Bioinformatics and functional genomics | url = https://archive.org/details/bioinformaticsfu00pevs_0 | url-access = registration |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780470085851 }}</ref> Functional genomics may also include studies of natural '''genetic variation''' '''over time''' (such as an organism's development) or '''space''' (such as its body regions), as well as functional disruptions such as mutations.

The promise of functional genomics is to generate and synthesize genomic and proteomic knowledge into an understanding of the dynamic properties of an organism. This could potentially provide a more complete picture of how the genome specifies function compared to studies of single genes. Integration of functional genomics data is often a part of [[systems biology]] approaches.

==Techniques and applications==
Functional genomics includes function-related aspects of the genome itself such as [[mutation]] and [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis), as well as the measurement of molecular activities. The latter comprise a number of ""-[[omics]]"" such as [[transcriptomics]] ([[gene expression]]), [[proteomics]] ([[protein production]]), and [[metabolomics]]. Functional genomics uses mostly [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] techniques to measure the abundance of many or all gene products such as [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s or [[protein]]s within a [[Biological specimen|biological sample]]. A more focused functional genomics approach might test the function of all variants of one gene and quantify the effects of mutants by using sequencing as a readout of activity. Together these measurement modalities endeavor to quantitate the various biological processes and improve our understanding of gene and protein functions and interactions.

===At the DNA level===

====Genetic interaction mapping====
{{Main|Epistasis}}
Systematic pairwise deletion of genes or inhibition of gene expression can be used to identify genes with related function, even if they do not interact physically. [[Epistasis]] refers to the fact that effects for two different gene knockouts may not be additive; that is, the phenotype that results when two genes are inhibited may be different from the sum of the effects of single knockouts.

====DNA/Protein interactions====
Proteins formed by the translation of the mRNA (messenger RNA, a coded information from DNA for protein synthesis) play a major role in regulating gene expression. To understand how they regulate gene expression it is necessary to identify DNA sequences that they interact with. Techniques have been developed to identify sites of DNA-protein interactions. These include [[ChIP-sequencing]], [[CUT&RUN sequencing]] and Calling Cards.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang H, Mayhew D, Chen X, Johnston M, Mitra RD | title = Calling Cards enable multiplexed identification of the genomic targets of DNA-binding proteins | journal = Genome Research | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 748–55 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21471402 | doi = 10.1101/gr.114850.110 | pmc = 3083092 }}</ref>

====DNA accessibility assays====
Assays have been developed to identify regions of the genome that are accessible. These regions of open chromatin are candidate regulatory regions. These assays include [[ATAC-seq]], [[DNase-Seq]] and [[FAIRE-Seq]].

===At the RNA level===

====Microarrays====
{{Main|DNA microarray}}
[[File:DNA microarray.svg|thumb|A [[DNA microarray]]]]
Microarrays measure the amount of mRNA in a sample that corresponds to a given gene or probe DNA sequence. Probe sequences are immobilized on a solid surface and allowed to [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] with fluorescently labeled ""target"" mRNA. The intensity of fluorescence of a spot is proportional to the amount of target sequence that has hybridized to that spot and therefore to the abundance of that mRNA sequence in the sample. Microarrays allow for the identification of candidate genes involved in a given process based on variation between transcript levels for different conditions and shared expression patterns with genes of known function.

====SAGE====
{{Main|Serial analysis of gene expression}}
[[Serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) is an alternate method of analysis based on RNA sequencing rather than hybridization. SAGE relies on the sequencing of 10–17 base pair tags which are unique to each gene. These tags are produced from [[Polyadenylation|poly-A mRNA]] and ligated end-to-end before sequencing. SAGE gives an unbiased measurement of the number of transcripts per cell, since it does not depend on prior knowledge of what transcripts to study (as microarrays do).

====RNA sequencing====
{{Main|RNA-Seq|MicroRNA sequencing}}
RNA sequencing has taken over microarray and SAGE technology in recent years, as noted in 2016, and has become the most efficient way to study  transcription and gene expression. This is typically done by [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencing]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hrdlickova R, Toloue M, Tian B | title = RNA-Seq methods for transcriptome analysis | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e1364 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27198714 | pmc = 5717752 | doi = 10.1002/wrna.1364 }}</ref>

A subset of sequenced RNAs are small RNAs, a class of non-coding RNA molecules that are key regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, or [[RNA silencing]]. Next-generation sequencing is the gold standard tool for [[non-coding RNA]] discovery, profiling and expression analysis.

====Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs)====
Massively parallel reporter assays is a technology to test the cis-regulatory activity of DNA sequences.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kwasnieski JC, Fiore C, Chaudhari HG, Cohen BA | title = High-throughput functional testing of ENCODE segmentation predictions | journal = Genome Research | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1595–602 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25035418 | pmc = 4199366 | doi = 10.1101/gr.173518.114 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patwardhan RP, Hiatt JB, Witten DM, Kim MJ, Smith RP, May D, Lee C, Andrie JM, Lee SI, Cooper GM, Ahituv N, Pennacchio LA, Shendure J | display-authors = 6 | title = Massively parallel functional dissection of mammalian enhancers in vivo | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 265–70 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22371081 | pmc = 3402344 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2136 }}</ref> MPRAs use a [[plasmid]] with a synthetic cis-regulatory element upstream of a promoter driving a synthetic gene such as Green Fluorescent Protein. A library of cis-regulatory elements is usually tested using MPRAs, a library can contain from hundreds to thousands of cis-regulatory elements. The cis-regulatory activity of the elements is assayed by using the downstream reporter activity. The activity of all the library members is assayed in parallel using barcodes for each cis-regulatory element. One limitation of MPRAs is that the activity is assayed on a plasmid and may not capture all aspects of gene regulation observed in the genome.

====STARR-seq====
{{Main|STARR-seq}}
STARR-seq is a technique similar to MPRAs to assay enhancer activity of randomly sheared genomic fragments. In the original publication,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold CD, Gerlach D, Stelzer C, Boryń ŁM, Rath M, Stark A | title = Genome-wide quantitative enhancer activity maps identified by STARR-seq | journal = Science | volume = 339 | issue = 6123 | pages = 1074–7 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23328393 | doi = 10.1126/science.1232542 | bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1074A | s2cid = 54488955 }}</ref> randomly sheared fragments of the ''Drosophila'' genome were placed downstream of a minimal promoter. Candidate enhancers amongst the randomly sheared fragments will transcribe themselves using the minimal promoter. By using sequencing as a readout and controlling for input amounts of each sequence the strength of putative enhancers are assayed by this method.

====Perturb-seq====
{{Main|Perturb-seq}}
[[File:Overview of Perturb-seq workflow.jpeg|thumb|517x517px|Overview of Perturb-seq workflow]]

Perturb-seq couples CRISPR mediated gene knockdowns with single-cell gene expression. Linear models are used to calculate the effect of the knockdown of a single gene on the expression of multiple genes.

===At the protein level===

====Yeast two-hybrid system====
{{Main|Two-hybrid screening}}
A yeast [[two-hybrid screening]] (Y2H) tests a ""bait"" protein against many potential interacting proteins (""prey"") to identify physical protein–protein interactions. This system is based on a transcription factor, originally GAL4,<ref name=pmid2547163>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fields S, Song O | title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions | journal = Nature | volume = 340 | issue = 6230 | pages = 245–6 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2547163 | doi = 10.1038/340245a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F | s2cid = 4320733 }}</ref> whose separate DNA-binding and transcription activation domains are both required in order for the protein to cause transcription of a reporter gene. In a Y2H screen, the ""bait"" protein is fused to the binding domain of GAL4, and a library of potential ""prey"" (interacting) proteins is recombinantly expressed in a vector with the activation domain. In vivo interaction of bait and prey proteins in a yeast cell brings the activation and binding domains of GAL4 close enough together to result in expression of a [[reporter gene]]. It is also possible to systematically test a library of bait proteins against a library of prey proteins to identify all possible interactions in a cell.

====AP/MS====
[[Affinity purification]] and [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS) is able to identify proteins that interact with one another in complexes. Complexes of proteins are allowed to form around a particular ""bait"" protein. The bait protein is identified using an antibody or a recombinant tag which allows it to be extracted along with any proteins that have formed a complex with it. The proteins are then digested into short [[peptide]] fragments and mass spectrometry is used to identify the proteins based on the mass-to-charge ratios of those fragments.

====Deep mutational scanning====
In deep mutational scanning every possible amino acid change in a given protein is first synthesized. The activity of each of these protein variants is assayed in parallel using barcodes for each variant. By comparing the activity to the wild-type protein, the effect of each mutation is identified. While it is possible to assay every possible single amino-acid change due to combinatorics two or more concurrent mutations are hard to test. Deep mutational scanning experiments have also been used to infer protein structure and protein-protein interactions.

===Mutagenesis and phenotyping===
An important functional feature of genes is the phenotype caused by mutations. Mutants can be produced by random mutations or by directed mutagenesis, including site-directed mutagenesis, deleting complete genes, or other techniques. 

====Knock-outs (gene deletions)====
Gene function can be investigated by systematically ""knocking out"" genes one by one. This is done by either [[gene knockout|deletion]] or disruption of function (such as by [[insertional mutagenesis]]) and the resulting organisms are screened for phenotypes that provide clues to the function of the disrupted gene. Knock-outs have been produced for whole genomes, i.e. by deleting all genes in a genome. For [[Essential gene|essential genes]], this is not possible, so other techniques are used, e.g. deleting a gene while expressing the gene from a [[plasmid]], using an inducible promoter, so that the level of gene product can be changed at will (and thus a ""functional"" deletion achieved).

====Site-directed mutagenesis====
[[Site-directed mutagenesis]] is used to mutate specific bases (and thus [[Amino acid|amino acids]]). This is critical to investigate the function of specific amino acids in a protein, e.g. in the active site of an [[enzyme]].

====RNAi====
{{Main|RNAi}}
RNA interference (RNAi) methods can be used to transiently silence or knockdown gene expression using ~20 base-pair double-stranded RNA typically delivered by transfection of synthetic ~20-mer short-interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) or by virally encoded short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RNAi screens, typically performed in cell culture-based assays or experimental organisms (such as ''C. elegans'') can be used to systematically disrupt nearly every gene in a genome or subsets of genes (sub-genomes); possible functions of disrupted genes can be assigned based on observed [[phenotype]]s.

====CRISPR screens====
[[File:Journal.pbio.2006951.g001-B.png|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of a CRISPR loss-of-function screen<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genome-wide CRISPR screens for Shiga toxins and ricin reveal Golgi proteins critical for glycosylation |vauthors=Tian S, Muneeruddin K, Choi MY, Tao L, Bhuiyan RH, Ohmi Y, Furukawa K, Furukawa K, Boland S, Shaffer SA, Adam RM, Dong M |date=27 November 2018 |journal= PLOS Biology |volume=16 |issue=11 |at=e2006951 |doi-access=free |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006951|pmid=30481169 |pmc=6258472 }}</ref>]]
CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to delete genes in a multiplexed manner in cell-lines. Quantifying the amount of guide-RNAs for each gene before and after the experiment can point towards essential genes. If a guide-RNA disrupts an essential gene it will lead to the loss of that cell and hence there will be a depletion of that particular guide-RNA after the screen. In a recent CRISPR-cas9 experiment in mammalian cell-lines, around 2000 genes were found to be essential in multiple cell-lines.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart T, Chandrashekhar M, Aregger M, Steinhart Z, Brown KR, MacLeod G, Mis M, Zimmermann M, Fradet-Turcotte A, Sun S, Mero P, Dirks P, Sidhu S, Roth FP, Rissland OS, Durocher D, Angers S, Moffat J | display-authors = 6 | title = High-Resolution CRISPR Screens Reveal Fitness Genes and Genotype-Specific Cancer Liabilities | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 6 | pages = 1515–26 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26627737 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.015 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelson T, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–87 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | pmc = 4089965 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}</ref> Some of these genes were essential in only one cell-line.

===Functional annotations for genes===

====Genome annotation====
{{Main|Genome project#Genome annotation}}
Putative genes can be identified by scanning a genome for regions likely to encode proteins, based on characteristics such as long [[open reading frames]], transcriptional initiation sequences, and [[polyadenylation]] sites. A sequence identified as a putative gene must be confirmed by further evidence, such as similarity to cDNA or EST sequences from the same organism, similarity of the predicted protein sequence to known proteins, association with promoter sequences, or evidence that mutating the sequence produces an observable phenotype.

====Rosetta stone approach====
The Rosetta stone approach is a computational method for de-novo protein function prediction. It is based on the hypothesis that some proteins involved in a given physiological process may exist as two separate genes in one organism and as a single gene in another. Genomes are scanned for sequences that are independent in one organism and in a single open reading frame in another. If two genes have fused, it is predicted that they have similar biological functions that make such co-regulation advantageous.

== Bioinformatics methods for Functional genomics ==
Because of the large quantity of data produced by these techniques and the desire to find biologically meaningful patterns, [[bioinformatics]] is crucial to analysis of functional genomics data. Examples of techniques in this class are [[data clustering]] or [[principal component analysis]] for unsupervised [[machine learning]] (class detection) as well as [[artificial neural network]]s or [[support vector machine]]s for supervised machine learning (class prediction, [[Statistical classification|classification]]). Functional enrichment analysis is used to determine the extent of over- or under-expression (positive- or negative- regulators in case of RNAi screens) of functional categories relative to a background sets. [[Gene ontology]] based enrichment analysis are provided by [[Gene set enrichment analysis#DAVID|DAVID]] and [[gene set enrichment analysis]] (GSEA),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Subramanian A, Tamayo P, Mootha VK, Mukherjee S, Ebert BL, Gillette MA, Paulovich A, Pomeroy SL, Golub TR, Lander ES, Mesirov JP | display-authors = 6 | title = Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 43 | pages = 15545–50 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16199517 | pmc = 1239896 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0506580102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215545S | doi-access = free }}</ref> pathway based analysis by Ingenuity<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ingenuity.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990125100225/http://www.ingenuity.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-01-25 |title=Ingenuity Systems |access-date=2007-12-31 }}</ref> and Pathway studio<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ariadnegenomics.com/products/pathway-studio/ |title=Ariadne Genomics: Pathway Studio |access-date=2007-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230035556/http://www.ariadnegenomics.com/products/pathway-studio |archive-date=2007-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and protein complex based analysis by COMPLEAT.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vinayagam A, Hu Y, Kulkarni M, Roesel C, Sopko R, Mohr SE, Perrimon N | title = Protein complex-based analysis framework for high-throughput data sets | journal = Science Signaling | volume = 6 | issue = 264 | pages = rs5 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23443684 | pmc = 3756668 | doi = 10.1126/scisignal.2003629 | url = http://www.flyrnai.org/compleat/ }}</ref>

[[File:Phydms.jpg|thumb|An overview of a phydms workflow]]

New computational methods have been developed for understanding the results of a deep mutational scanning experiment. 'phydms' compares the result of a deep mutational scanning experiment to a phylogenetic tree.<ref name=""Hilton_2017"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilton SK, Doud MB, Bloom JD | title = phydms: software for phylogenetic analyses informed by deep mutational scanning | journal = PeerJ | volume = 5 | pages = e3657 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28785526 | pmc = 5541924 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.3657 }}</ref> This allows the user to infer if the selection process in nature applies similar constraints on a protein as the results of the deep mutational scan indicate.

Deep mutational structure can also be used to infer protein structure. Strong positive epistasis between two mutations in a deep mutational scan can be indicative of two parts of the protein that are close to each other in 3-D space.

==Consortium projects focused on Functional Genomics==

=== The ENCODE project ===
{{Main|ENCODE}}
The [[ENCODE]] (Encyclopedia of DNA elements) project is an in-depth analysis of the human genome whose goal is to identify all the functional elements of genomic DNA, in both coding and non-coding regions. Important results include evidence from genomic tiling arrays that most nucleotides are transcribed as coding transcripts, non-coding RNAs, or random transcripts, the discovery of additional transcriptional regulatory sites, further elucidation of chromatin-modifying mechanisms.

=== The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project ===
[[File:Nature24277-f1.jpg|thumb|Samples used and eQTLs discovered in GTEx v6]]
The GTEx project is a human genetics project aimed at understanding the role of genetic variation in shaping variation in the transcriptome across tissues. The project has collected a variety of tissue samples (> 50 different tissues) from more than 700 post-mortem donors. This has resulted in the collection of >11,000 samples. GTEx has helped understand the tissue-sharing and tissue-specificity of [[eQTL]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues |journal=Nature |date=12 October 2017 |volume=550 |issue=7675 |pages=204–213 |doi=10.1038/nature24277|pmid=29022597 |pmc=5776756 |url=http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/34202/1/guigo_nature_gene.pdf |author1=GTEx Consortium |last2=Laboratory |first2=Data Analysis &Coordinating Center (Ldacc)—Analysis Working Group. |author3=Statistical Methods groups—Analysis Working Group |author4=Enhancing GTEx (eGTEx) groups |author5=NIH Common Fund |author6=NIH/NCI |author7=NIH/NHGRI |author8=NIH/NIMH |author9=NIH/NIDA |author10=Biospecimen Collection Source Site—NDRI |author11=Biospecimen Collection Source Site—RPCI |author12=Biospecimen Core Resource—VARI |author13=Brain Bank Repository—University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank |author14=Leidos Biomedical—Project Management |author15=ELSI Study |author16=Genome Browser Data Integration &Visualization—EBI |last17=Genome Browser Data Integration &Visualization—Ucsc Genomics Institute |first17=University of California Santa Cruz. |author18=Lead analysts |last19=Laboratory |first19=Data Analysis &Coordinating Center (Ldacc):. |author20=NIH program management |author21=Biospecimen collection |author22=Pathology |author23=eQTL manuscript working group |last24=Battle |first24=A. |last25=Brown |first25=C.

Pathogens may be intentionally or unintentionally [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] to change their characteristics, including [[virulence]] or [[toxicity]].<ref name=""GCRs bio-chapter"" /> When intentional, these [[Mutation|mutations]] can serve to adapt the pathogen to a laboratory setting, understand the mechanism of transmission or pathogenesis, or in the development of therapeutics.

A '''gene knockout''' (abbreviation: '''KO''') is a [[genetics|genetic]] technique in which one of an [[organism]]'s [[gene]]s is made inoperative (""knocked out"" of the organism). However, KO can also refer to the gene that is knocked out or the organism that carries the gene knockout. '''Knockout organisms''' or simply '''knockouts''' are used to study gene function, usually by investigating the effect of gene loss. Researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals.

The KO technique is essentially the opposite of a [[gene knock-in]]. Knocking out two genes simultaneously in an organism is known as a '''double knockout''' ('''DKO'''). Similarly the terms '''triple knockout''' ('''TKO''') and '''quadruple knockouts''' ('''QKO''') are used to describe three or four knocked out genes, respectively. However, one needs to distinguish between [[Zygosity|heterozygous and homozygous]] KOs. In the former, only one of two gene copies ([[alleles]]) is knocked out, in the latter both are knocked out.

==Methods==
Knockouts are accomplished through a variety of techniques. Originally, '''naturally occurring [[mutation]]s''' were identified and then gene loss or inactivation had to be established by [[DNA sequencing]] or other methods.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21766/?term=knockout | title = An Introduction to Genetic Analysis | edition = 7th | vauthors = Griffiths AJ, Miller JH, Suzuki DT, Lewontin WC, Gelbart WM | isbn = 978-0-7167-3771-1 | location = New York | publisher = W.

=== Homologous recombination ===
{{Main|Homologous recombination}}Traditionally, [[homologous recombination]] was the main method for causing a gene knockout. This method involves creating a [[DNA construct]] containing the desired mutation. For knockout purposes, this typically involves a drug resistance marker in place of the desired knockout gene.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Bradford|last2=Limaye|first2=Advait|last3=Kulkarni|first3=Ashok B.|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|volume=44|pages=Unit 19.12 19.12.1–17|doi=10.1002/0471143030.cb1912s44|pmid = 19731224|pmc=2782548|isbn = 978-0471143031|title=Overview: Generation of Gene Knockout Mice|journal=Current Protocols in Cell Biology}}</ref> The construct will also contain a minimum of 2kb of [[Sequence homology|homology]] to the target sequence.<ref name="":0"" /> The construct can be delivered to [[stem cell]]s either through [[microinjection]] or [[electroporation]].<ref name="":0"" /> This method then relies on the cell's own repair mechanisms to recombine the DNA construct into the existing DNA. This results in the sequence of the gene being altered, and most cases the gene will be [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] into a nonfunctional [[protein]], if it is translated at all. However, this is an inefficient process, as homologous recombination accounts for only 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup href=""Zygosity"">-3</sup> of DNA integrations.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> Often, the drug selection marker on the construct is used to select for cells in which the recombination event has occurred.

These stem cells now lacking the gene could be used [[in vivo]], for instance in mice, by inserting them into early embryos.<ref name="":0"" /> If the resulting chimeric mouse contained the genetic change in their germline, this could then be passed on offspring.<ref name="":0"" />

In [[diploid]] organisms, which contain two [[allele]]s for most genes, and may as well contain several related genes that collaborate in the same role, additional rounds of transformation and selection are performed until every targeted gene is knocked out.  [[Selective breeding]] may be required to produce [[homozygous]] knockout animals.

[[File:Frameshift_mutations_(13080927393).jpg|thumb|303x303px|Fig 1. Frameshift mutation resulting from a single base pair deletion, causing altered amino acid sequence and premature stop codon.]]There are currently three methods in use that involve precisely targeting a DNA sequence in order to introduce a double-stranded break.

=== Knockin ===
{{Main|Gene knockin}}
[[Gene knockin]] is similar to gene knockout, but it replaces a gene with another instead of deleting it.

== Types ==

=== Conditional knockouts ===
{{Main|Conditional gene knockout}}
A conditional gene knockout allows gene deletion in a tissue in a tissue specific manner. This is required in place of a gene knockout if the null mutation would lead to [[embryonic death]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Le|first1=Yunzheng|last2=Sauer|first2=Brian|date=2001-03-01|title=Conditional gene knockout using cre recombinase|journal=Molecular Biotechnology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=269–275|doi=10.1385/MB:17:3:269|pmid=11434315|s2cid=41578035|issn=1073-6085}}</ref> or a specific tissue or cell type is of specific interest. This is done by introducing short sequences called loxP sites around the gene. These sequences will be introduced into the germ-line via the same mechanism as a knock-out. This germ-line can then be crossed to another germline containing [[Cre recombinase|Cre-recombinase]] which is a viral enzyme that can recognize these sequences, recombines them and deletes the gene flanked by these sites.

Knockouts are primarily used to understand the role of a specific [[gene]] or [[DNA]] region by comparing the knockout [[organism]] to a [[wildtype]] with a similar [[Heredity|genetic]] background.

Knockout [[organisms]] are also used as [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] tools in the development of [[drugs]], to target specific [[biological processes]] or [[Deficiency (medicine)|deficiencies]] by using a specific knockout, or to understand the [[mechanism of action]] of a [[drug]] by using a [[library]] of knockout [[organisms]] spanning the entire [[genome]], such as in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/deletions3.html|title=YeastDeletionWebPages|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref>

31,Insert (molecular biology),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_(molecular_biology),"In [[Molecular biology]], an '''insert''' is a piece of [[DNA]] that is inserted into a larger DNA [[Cloning vector|vector]] by a [[recombinant DNA]] technique, such as [[DNA ligase|ligation]] or [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. This allows it to be multiplied, selected, further manipulated or [[Gene expression|expressed]] in a [[Host (biology)|host organism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=insert - Terminology of Molecular Biology for insert – GenScript|url=https://www.genscript.com/molecular-biology-glossary/10173/insert|website=www.genscript.com|access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref>

Inserts can range from physical [[nucleotide]] additions using a technique system or the addition of artificial structures on a molecule via [[Mutagen|mutagenic]] chemicals, such as [[ethidium bromide]] or crystals.

Inserts into the [[genome]] of an organism normally occur due to natural causes. These causes include environmental conditions and intracellular processes. Environmental inserts range from exposure to radioactive radiation such as [[Ultraviolet]], mutagenic chemicals, or [[DNA virus|DNA viruses]]. Intracellular inserts can occur through heritable changes in parent cells or errors in [[DNA replication]] or [[DNA repair]].

Gene insertion techniques can be used for characteristic mutations in an organism for a desired [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] [[gene expression]]. A gene insert change can be expressed in a large variety of ends. These variants can range from the loss, or gain, of protein function to changes in physical structure i.e., hair, or eye, color. The goal of changes in expression are focused on a gain of function in proteins for regulation<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hahne JC, Lampis A, Valeri N | title = Vault RNAs: hidden gems in RNA and protein regulation | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 1487–1499 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33063126 | pmc = 7904556 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-020-03675-9 }}</ref> or to termination of cellular function for prevention of disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine B, Kroemer G | title = Biological Functions of Autophagy Genes: A Disease Perspective | journal = Cell | volume = 176 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 11–42 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30633901 | pmc = 6347410 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.048 }}</ref> The results of the variations are dependent on the place in the genome the addition, or mutation is located. The aim is to learn, understand, and possibly predict the expression of genetic material in organisms using physical and chemical analysis. To see the results of genetic mutations, or inserts, techniques such as [[DNA sequencing]], [[gel electrophoresis]], [[immunoassay]], or [[microscopy]]  can observe [[mutation]].

32,Site-directed mutagenesis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis,"'''Site-directed mutagenesis''' is a [[molecular biology]] method that is used to make specific and intentional mutating changes to the [[DNA sequence]] of a [[gene]] and any [[gene product]]s. Also called '''site-specific mutagenesis''' or '''oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis''', it is used for investigating the structure and biological activity of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]] molecules, and for [[protein engineering]].

Site-directed mutagenesis is one of the most important laboratory techniques for creating [[Library (biology)|DNA libraries]] by introducing mutations into DNA sequences. There are numerous methods for achieving site-directed mutagenesis, but with decreasing costs of [[oligonucleotide synthesis]], [[artificial gene synthesis]] is now occasionally used as an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis. Since 2013, the development of the [[CRISPR]]/Cas9 technology, based on a prokaryotic viral defense system, has also allowed for the [[Genome editing|editing of the genome]], and mutagenesis may be performed ''in vivo'' with relative ease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Lander ES, Zhang F | title = Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 1262–78 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24906146 | pmc = 4343198 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010 }}</ref>

Mullis]], who invented [[polymerase chain reaction]].

==Basic mechanism==
The basic procedure requires the [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesis]] of a short DNA primer.  This synthetic primer contains the desired mutation and is complementary to the template DNA around the mutation site so it can [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] with the DNA in the gene of interest.  The mutation may be a single base change (a [[point mutation]]), multiple base changes, [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]], or [[Insertion (genetics)|insertion]].  The single-strand primer is then extended using a [[DNA polymerase]], which copies the rest of the gene. The gene thus copied contains the mutated site, and is then introduced into a host cell in a vector and [[Molecular cloning|cloned]]. Finally, mutants are selected by [[DNA sequencing]] to check that they contain the desired mutation.

==Approaches==

The original method using single-primer extension was inefficient due to a low yield of mutants.  This resulting mixture contains both the original unmutated template as well as the mutant strand, producing a mixed population of mutant and non-mutant progenies. Furthermore, the template used is [[DNA methylation|methylated]] while the mutant strand is unmethylated, and the mutants may be counter-selected due to presence of [[mismatch repair]] system that favors the methylated template DNA, resulting in fewer mutants.  Many approaches have since been developed to improve the efficiency of mutagenesis.

A large number of methods are available to effect site-directed mutagenesis,<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Jeff |editor-last=Braman |title=In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols |publisher=Humana Press |edition=2nd |year=2002 |isbn=978-0896039100 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=182 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/invitromutagenes00bram }}</ref> although most of them have rarely been used in laboratories since the early 2000s, as newer techniques allow for simpler and easier ways of introducing site-specific mutation into genes.

=== Kunkel's method ===
In 1985, [[Thomas Kunkel (geneticist)|Thomas Kunkel]] introduced a technique that reduces the need to select for the mutants.<ref>{{cite journal

 }}</ref> The DNA fragment to be mutated is inserted into a [[phagemid]] such as [[M13 bacteriophage|M13mp18/19]] and is then transformed into an ''[[E. coli]]'' strain deficient in two enzymes, [[dUTP diphosphatase|dUTPase]] (''[[DUT (gene)|dut]]'') and [[Uracil-DNA glycosylase|uracil deglycosidase]] (''udg''). Both enzymes are part of a [[DNA repair]] pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant ''E. coli'' replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is [[DNA extraction|extracted]] from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis.  An [[oligonucleotide]] containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The heteroduplex DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP.  The DNA is then transformed into an [[E. coli]] strain carrying the wildtype ''dut'' and ''udg'' genes. Here, the uracil-containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.

=== Cassette mutagenesis===
Unlike other methods, cassette mutagenesis need not involve primer extension using DNA polymerase.  In this method, a fragment of DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> It involves the cleavage by a [[restriction enzyme]] at a site in the plasmid and subsequent [[DNA ligase|ligation]] of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting sticky ends of the plasmid and insert to ligate to one another.  This method can generate mutants at close to 100% efficiency, but is limited by the availability of suitable restriction sites flanking the site that is to be mutated.

===PCR site-directed mutagenesis===
[[File:Site-directed mutagenesis library cloning steps.svg|thumb|Depiction of one common way to clone a site-directed mutagenesis library (i.e., using degenerate oligos). The gene of interest is PCRed with oligos that contain a region that is perfectly complementary to the template (blue), and one that differs from the template by one or more nucleotides (red). Many such primers containing degeneracy in the non-complementary region are pooled into the same PCR, resulting in many different PCR products with different mutations in that region (individual mutants shown with different colors below).]]

The limitation of restriction sites in cassette mutagenesis may be overcome using [[polymerase chain reaction]] with [[oligonucleotide]] ""[[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]]"", such that a larger fragment may be generated, covering two convenient restriction sites.  The exponential amplification in PCR produces a fragment containing the desired mutation in sufficient quantity to be separated from the original, unmutated plasmid by [[gel electrophoresis]], which may then be inserted in the original context using standard recombinant molecular biology techniques.  There are many variations of the same technique.  The simplest method places the mutation site toward one of the ends of the fragment whereby one of two oligonucleotides used for generating the fragment contains the mutation.  This involves a single step of PCR, but still has the inherent problem of requiring a suitable restriction site near the mutation site unless a very long primer is used.  Other variations, therefore, employ three or four oligonucleotides, two of which may be non-mutagenic oligonucleotides that cover two convenient restriction sites and generate a fragment that can be digested and ligated into a plasmid, whereas the mutagenic oligonucleotide may be complementary to a location within that fragment well away from any convenient restriction site.  These methods require multiple steps of PCR so that the final fragment to be ligated can contain the desired mutation. The design process for generating a fragment with the desired mutation and relevant restriction sites can be cumbersome. Software tools like SDM-Assist<ref name=""KarnikKarnik2013"">{{cite journal|last1=Karnik|first1=Abhijit|last2=Karnik|first2=Rucha|last3=Grefen|first3=Christopher|title=SDM-Assist software to design site-directed mutagenesis primers introducing ""silent"" restriction sites|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=14|issue=1|year=2013|pages=105|issn=1471-2105|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-105|pmid=23522286|pmc=3644487}}</ref> can simplify the process.

===Whole plasmid mutagenesis===
For plasmid manipulations, other site-directed mutagenesis techniques have been supplanted largely by techniques that are highly efficient but relatively simple, easy to use, and commercially available as a kit.  An example of these techniques is the Quikchange method,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Site-directed mutagenesis in one day with >80% efficiency.  |author=Papworth, C., Bauer, J. C., Braman, J. and Wright, D. A. |year=1996 |journal=Strategies |volume=9 |issue=3|pages=3–4}}</ref> wherein a pair of complementary mutagenic primers are used to amplify the entire plasmid in a [[Thermal cycler|thermocycling]] reaction using a high-fidelity non-strand-displacing DNA polymerase such as [[Pfu DNA polymerase|''pfu'' polymerase]].  The reaction generates a [[Nick (DNA)|nicked]], circular DNA.   The template DNA must be eliminated by enzymatic digestion with a [[restriction enzyme]] such as ''Dpn''I, which is specific for methylated DNA.  All DNA produced from most ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains would be methylated; the template plasmid that is biosynthesized in ''E. coli'' will, therefore, be digested, while the mutated plasmid, which is generated ''in vitro'' and is therefore unmethylated, would be left undigested. Note that, in these double-strand plasmid mutagenesis methods, while the thermocycling reaction may be used, the DNA need not be exponentially amplified as in a PCR. Instead, the amplification is linear, and it is therefore inaccurate to describe them as a PCR, since there is no chain reaction.

Note that ''pfu'' polymerase can become strand-displacing at higher extension temperature (≥70&nbsp;°C) which can result in the failure of the experiment, therefore the extension reaction should be performed at the recommended temperature of 68&nbsp;°C.  In some applications, this method has been observed to lead to insertion of multiple copies of primers.<ref name=""pmid19566935"">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Edelheit | first1 = O | last2 = Hanukoglu | first2 = A | last3 = Hanukoglu | first3 = I | title = Simple and efficient site-directed mutagenesis using two single-primer reactions in parallel to generate mutants for protein structure-function studies | journal = BMC Biotechnol | volume = 9 | page = 61 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-9-61 | pmid = 19566935 | pmc=2711942}}</ref> A variation of this method, called SPRINP, prevents this artifact and has been used in different types of site directed mutagenesis.<ref name=""pmid19566935"" />

Site-directed mutagenesis is used to generate mutations that may produce a [[rational design|rationally designed]] protein that has improved or special properties (i.e.protein engineering).

'''Investigative tools''' – specific mutations in DNA allow the function and properties of a DNA sequence or a protein to be investigated in a rational approach. Furthermore, single amino-acid changes by site-directed mutagenesis in proteins can help understand the importance of post-translational modifications. For instance changing a particular serine (phosphoacceptor) to an alanine (phospho-non-acceptor) in a substrate protein blocks the attachment of a phosphate group, thereby allows the phosphorylation to be investigated. This approach has been used to uncover the phosphorylation of the protein [[CREB-binding protein|CBP]] by the kinase [[HIPK2]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001  | url = https://research-explorer.app.ist.ac.at/download/1663/5321/IST-2016-578-v1%2B1_CLS-D-15-00072R1_.pdf }}</ref> Another comprehensive approach is site [[saturation mutagenesis]] where one [[codon]] or a set of codons may be substituted with all possible [[amino acid]]s at the specific positions.<ref name="":0"">{{cite journal|last=Reetz|first=M.

'''Commercial applications''' – Proteins may be engineered to produce mutant forms that are tailored for a specific application.  For example, commonly used laundry detergents may contain [[subtilisin]], whose wild-type form has a methionine that can be oxidized by bleach, significantly reducing the activity the protein in the process.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |date=October 10, 1969 |volume= 244 | issue=19 |pages=5333–8 |title= The effect on subtilisin activity of oxidizing a methionine residue |vauthors=Stauffer CE, Etson D |doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)63664-6 |pmid=5344139 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/244/19/5333 |doi-access=free }}</ref> This methionine may be replaced by alanine or other residues, making it resistant to oxidation thereby keeping the protein active in the presence of bleach.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |date=10 June 1985 |volume= 260 | issue=11 |pages=6518–21 |title=Engineering an enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis to be resistant to chemical oxidation |vauthors=Estell DA, Graycar TP, Wells JA |doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)88811-1 |pmid=3922976 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/260/11/6518.long |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Gene synthesis ==

As the cost of DNA oligonucleotides synthesis falls, [[artificial gene synthesis|artificial synthesis of a complete gene]] is now a viable method for introducing mutation into gene. This method allows for extensive mutagenesis over multiples sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of gene to optimise it for a particular organism.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yg3OBQAAQBAJ&q=codon&pg=PA13 |title=Artificial DNA: Methods and Applications |editor= Yury E.

===Crop technologies===

The centerpiece of the Metabolix's plant technology is [[polyhydroxybutyrate]] (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with [[switchgrass]], [[camelina]], [[sugarcane]], as well as [[tobacco]].<ref name=""Crop Technologies"">{{Cite web|title=Yield10Bio|url=https://www.yield10bio.com/|access-date=2021-03-07|website=www.yield10bio.com|language=en}}</ref>

In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/22/idUS228482+22-Oct-2009+BW20091022 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130411180534/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/22/idUS228482+22-Oct-2009+BW20091022 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2013-04-11 |title = Metabolix Completes Field Trial of Bioplastic-Producing Tobacco Crop |date = 2009-10-22 |access-date = 2013-03-01}}</ref>

In 2012, Metabolix secured an [[ARPA-E]] grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.<ref name=""Seiffert_2"">{{cite web |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2012/12/metabolix-stock-up-20-percent-after-arpa.html?page=all |title = Metabolix stock up 20 percent after ARPA-E grant |last = Seiffert |first = Don |publisher = Boston Business Journal |date = 2012-12-06 |work= Mass High Tech |access-date= 2013-03-01}}</ref>

In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://ir.yield10bio.com/static-files/2201fe9c-cb71-4ee9-a718-dd907883c720 |title = U.S. Department of Energy Awards Metabolix $6 Million Grant to Develop Renewable Biofuels |date = 2011-05-16 |access-date = 2013-03-01}}</ref>

In 2017, Yield10 participated in a Department of Energy program to help boost Camelina oilseed. <ref>{{cite web |url = https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/10m-doe-grant-to-help-boost-camelina-oilseed-yield/ |title = $10M DOE GRANT TO HELP BOOST CAMELINA OILSEED YIELD |last = Schnell |first = Danny |date = 2017-09-14 |access-date = 2019-05-09}}</ref>

===Platforms===

====C3====
C3 is the most common form of photosynthesis, existing in most crops suitable for human consumption, including wheat, canola, soybean and rice.
In 2019 Yield10 announced results from its 2018 field test, claiming that its C3003 gene trait showed an 11% increase in seed yield among canola crops, when compared to control plants. Similarly, C3003 met its objectives for soybean yield, and showed an increase in Camelina.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.seedquest.com/news.php?type=news&id_article=103694&id_region=&id_category=&id_crop= |title = Yield10 Bioscience reports encouraging results from 2018 field tests of C3003 and announces advancement of C3003 into commercial development for canola |date = 2019-01-15 |access-date= 2019-05-09}}</ref>

====C4====
C4 photosynthesis plants, like corn and sugar cane, possess a more complex system of metabolic pathways.<ref name=""products"">[https://www.yield10bio.com/crop-science/novel-crop-traits Novel Crop Traits]</ref>
In 2018, Yield reported promising results for its C3004 gene trait in Camelina lines, following growth chamber studies.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://sciencetrends.com/increasing-crop-yield-through-smart-approaches-in-trait-discovery/ |title = Increasing Crop Yield Through Smart Approaches In Trait Discovery |date = 2018-11-03 |access-date= 2019-05-09}}</ref>

====CRISPR====
Yield10 has also commenced development of CRISPR-enabled technology to impact crop yield. The company received a nonregulated status letter from the USDA-APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) acknowledging that its camelina line has had a gene disrupted using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, resulting in the desired phenotype.

====PHA-based Biomaterials====
In 2019, Yield10 filed a U.S. Patent application for new technology enabling low-cost production of PHA-based biomaterials, knowing for their use in water treatment to remove nitrogen and phosphates, to maintain the viability and vigor of Camelina seed.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://bioplasticsnews.com/2019/06/18/yield10-bioscience-files-patent-for-new-pha-biomaterials-technology/ |title = Yield10 Bioscience Files Patent For New PHA Biomaterials Technology |last = Barrett |first = Axel |date = 2019-06-18 |access-date= 2019-09-05}}</ref>

An '''antibiotic''' is a type of [[antimicrobial]] substance active against [[bacteria]]. It is the most important type of [[antibacterial agent]] for fighting [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infections]], and antibiotic [[medication]]s are widely used in the [[therapy|treatment]] and [[antibiotic prophylaxis|prevention]] of such infections.<ref name=""NHSB"">{{cite web |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Antibiotics-penicillins/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Antibiotics| publisher=NHS |date=5 June 2014 |access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/antibiotics/Pages/factsExperts.aspx |title=Factsheet for experts |publisher=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221183712/http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/antibiotics/Pages/factsExperts.aspx |archive-date=21 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They may either [[bactericide|kill]] or [[bacteriostatic agent|inhibit the growth]] of bacteria.

Sometimes, the term ''antibiotic''—literally ""opposing life"", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots ἀντι ''anti'', ""against"" and βίος ''bios'', ""life""—is broadly used to refer to any substance used against [[microbe]]s, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as [[penicillin]]) are those produced naturally (by one [[microorganism]] fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as [[sulfonamide]]s and [[antiseptic]]s) are [[total synthesis|fully synthetic]]. However, both classes have the same goal of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in [[antimicrobial chemotherapy]]. ""Antibacterials"" include [[antiseptic]] drugs, [[antibacterial soap]]s, and chemical [[disinfectant]]s, whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/agents.shtml#1 |title=General Background: Antibiotic Agents |work=Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214195917/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/agents.shtml#1 |archive-date=14 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[antibiotic use in livestock|sometimes in livestock feed]].

===Combination therapy===

In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, [[combination therapy]] (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their [[drug synergy|synergistic]] effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect.<ref name=""Antagonism between bacteriostatic"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ocampo PS, Lázár V, Papp B, Arnoldini M, Abel zur Wiesch P, Busa-Fekete R, Fekete G, Pál C, Ackermann M, Bonhoeffer S | display-authors = 6 | title = Antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics is prevalent | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 58 | issue = 8 | pages = 4573–82 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24867991 | pmc = 4135978 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.02463-14 }}</ref><ref name=""Bollenbach - interactions"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bollenbach T | title = Antimicrobial interactions: mechanisms and implications for drug discovery and resistance evolution | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 27 | pages = 1–9 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26042389 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2015.05.008 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] infections may be treated with a combination therapy of [[fusidic acid]] and rifampicin.<ref name=""Antagonism between bacteriostatic""/> Antibiotics used in combination may also be antagonistic and the combined effects of the two antibiotics may be less than if one of the antibiotics was given as a [[monotherapy]].<ref name=""Antagonism between bacteriostatic""/> For example, [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracyclines]] are antagonists to [[penicillin]]s.

Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their [[mechanism of action]], [[chemical structure]], or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes.<ref name=""CALDERIN2007""/> Those that target the bacterial cell wall ([[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s) or the cell membrane ([[polymyxin]]s), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ([[rifamycin]]s, [[lipiarmycin]]s, [[quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]], and [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]) have [[bactericide|bactericidal]] activities. [[Protein synthesis inhibitor]]s ([[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamides]], and [[tetracycline]]s) are usually [[bacteriostatic]] (with the exception of bactericidal [[aminoglycoside]]s).<ref name=""The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease""/> Further categorization is based on their target specificity. ""Narrow-spectrum"" antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as [[gram-negative]] or [[gram-positive]], whereas [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year break in discovering classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics were introduced to clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic [[lipopeptide]]s (such as [[daptomycin]]), [[glycylcyclines]] (such as [[tigecycline]]), [[oxazolidinone]]s (such as [[linezolid]]), and [[lipiarmycin]]s (such as [[fidaxomicin]]).<ref>{{cite book |vauthors= Cunha BA |title= Antibiotic Essentials |year= 2009 |publisher= Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn= 978-0-7637-7219-2 |page= 180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Srivastava A, Talaue M, Liu S, Degen D, Ebright RY, Sineva E, Chakraborty A, Druzhinin SY, Chatterjee S, Mukhopadhyay J, Ebright YW, Zozula A, Shen J, Sengupta S, Niedfeldt RR, Xin C, Kaneko T, Irschik H, Jansen R, Donadio S, Connell N, Ebright RH | display-authors = 6 | title = New target for inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase: 'switch region' | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 532–43 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21862392 | pmc = 3196380 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.030 }}</ref>

The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may [[natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.<ref name=""Balancing the drug-resistance equation""/> For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].<ref name=""Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance""/> Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.<ref name=""voanews.com""/>

Resistance may take the form of biodegradation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Topp E, Chapman R, Devers-Lamrani M, Hartmann A, Marti R, Martin-Laurent F, Sabourin L, Scott A, Sumarah M | display-authors = 6 | title = Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term Exposure, and Isolation of a Sulfamethazine-degrading sp | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23673752 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2012.0162 | url = http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610 }}</ref>
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,<ref name=""Witte2004""/> but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Dyer BD |title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8854-2|chapter=Chapter 9, Pathogens|chapter-url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&qid=1305345229&sr=1-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobact0000dyer}}</ref>

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.<ref name=""The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?""/>

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms.<ref name=""D'Costa2011""/> Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.<ref name=""Gladki2013""/>

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.<ref name=""Alekshun2007""/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawlowski AC, Wang W, Koteva K, Barton HA, McArthur AG, Wright GD | title = A diverse intrinsic antibiotic resistome from a cave bacterium | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13803 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27929110 | pmc = 5155152 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13803 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713803P }}</ref> For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]].

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as ""superbugs"", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were, for a while, well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.<ref>""[https://web.archive.org/web/20090406170131/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]"".

{{Main|Antibiotic misuse}}

Per ''The ICU Book'' ""The first rule of antibiotics is to try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.""<ref name=""Marino""/> Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. [[Self-prescribing]] of antibiotics is an example of misuse.<ref name=""Larson2007""/> Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.<ref name=""pmid15993671""/><ref name=""Larson2007""/> The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s.<ref name=""voanews.com""/><ref name=""Hawkey2008""/> Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.<ref name=""Hawkey2008""/>

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. One study on [[respiratory tract infection]]s found ""physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them"".<ref name=""pmid17467120""/> Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.<ref name=""pmid17509729""/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coxeter P, Del Mar CB, McGregor L, Beller EM, Hoffmann TC | title = Interventions to facilitate shared decision making to address antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = CD010907 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26560888 | pmc = 6464273 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010907.pub2 }}</ref> The lack of rapid point of care diagnostic tests, particularly in resource-limited settings is considered one of the drivers of antibiotic misuse.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendelson M, Røttingen JA, Gopinathan U, Hamer DH, Wertheim H, Basnyat B, Butler C, Tomson G, Balasegaram M | display-authors = 6 | title = Maximising access to achieve appropriate human antimicrobial use in low-income and middle-income countries | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10014 | pages = 188–98 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26603919 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00547-4 | s2cid = 13904240 }}</ref>

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics.<ref name=""Larson2007""/> The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the US Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance.

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States, the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to [[antibiotic use in livestock|use of antibiotics in livestock]] was raised by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1977. In March 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock, which violated FDA regulations.<ref>{{cite news |title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792 |access-date=24 March 2012 |newspaper=MedPage Today|date=23 March 2012| vauthors = Gever J }}</ref>

===Synthetic antibiotics derived from dyes===
[[File:Salvarsan-montage.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Arsphenamine, also known as salvarsan, discovered in 1907 by Paul Ehrlich.]]
Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.<ref name=""CALDERIN2007""/> Ehrlich noted certain dyes would colour human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the first synthetic antibacterial [[Organoarsenic chemistry|organoarsenic compound]] [[salvarsan]],<ref name=""CALDERIN2007""/><ref name=""Limbird2004""/><ref name=""Bosch2008""/> now called arsphenamine.
[[File:Paul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Ehrlich]] and [[Sahachiro Hata]] ]]
This heralded the era of antibacterial treatment that was begun with the discovery of a series of arsenic-derived synthetic antibiotics by both [[Alfred Bertheim]] and Ehrlich in 1907.<ref name=""ReferenceB""/><ref name=""goodman""/> Ehrlich and Bertheim had experimented with various chemicals derived from dyes to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] in mice and [[spirochaeta]] infection in rabbits. While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and [[Sahachiro Hata]], a Japanese bacteriologist working with Erlich in the quest for a drug to treat [[syphilis]], achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments.

Observations about the growth of some microorganisms inhibiting the growth of other microorganisms have been reported since the late 19th century.

In 1897, doctoral student [[Ernest Duchesne]] submitted a dissertation, ""{{lang|fr|Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes}}"" (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes),<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Duchesne E | translator = Witty M |title= Duchesne's Antagonism between molds and bacteria, an English Colloquial Translation| isbn= 978-1-5498-1696-3|date= 23 September 2017 }}</ref> the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of moulds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and moulds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. Duchesne observed that ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' was eliminated by ''Penicillium glaucum'' when they were both grown in the same culture. He also observed that when he [[inoculation|inoculated]] laboratory animals with lethal doses of [[typhoid]] bacilli together with ''Penicillium glaucum'', the animals did not contract typhoid.

[[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]] and [[Edward Abraham]] succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, [[penicillin G]], in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, [[Norman Heatley]] developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Jones DS, Jones JH |date=1 December 2014|title=Sir Edward Penley Abraham CBE. 10 June 1913 – 9 May 1999|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/5.1|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=60|pages=5–22|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2014.0002|issn=0080-4606|doi-access=free}}</ref> and then later confirmed by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic [[sulfonamides]]. (see below) The development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.<ref name=""Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes""/> For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1945/summary/ | access-date = 13 January 2018 | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1945 | publisher= The Nobel Prize Organization}}</ref>

Florey credited [[René Dubos]] with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.<ref name=Epps2006/> In 1939, coinciding with the start of [[World War II]], Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[tyrothricin]], a compound of 20% [[gramicidin]] and 80% [[tyrocidine]], from ''Bacillus brevis''. It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II.<ref name=""Epps2006""/> Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and the [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II and limited access during the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Capocci M | title = Cold drugs.

===Late 20th century===
During the mid-20th century, the number of new antibiotic substances introduced for medical use increased significantly. From 1935 to 1968, 12 new classes were launched.

Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor.<ref name=""IDSA2013""/> In the US, the [[Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment]] (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|publisher=US Congress|date=12 December 2013}}</ref> According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, ""By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.""<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Clarke T |title=U.S. Congress urged to pass bill to speed development of antibiotics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-antibiotics-idUSKBN0HE25W20140919|agency=Reuters|access-date=19 September 2014|newspaper=Reuters |date=19 September 2014 }}</ref>

Virulence factors are molecules, cellular structures and regulatory systems that enable bacteria to evade the body's immune defenses (e.g. [[urease]], [[staphyloxanthin]]), move towards, attach to, and/or invade human cells (e.g. [[type IV pili]], [[Bacterial adhesin|adhesin]]s, [[internalin]]s), coordinate the activation of virulence genes (e.g. [[quorum sensing]]), and cause disease (e.g. [[exotoxin]]s).<ref name=""pmid31295426 "">{{cite journal | vauthors = Theuretzbacher U, Piddock LJ | title = Non-traditional Antibacterial Therapeutic Options and Challenges | journal = Cell Host & Microbe | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–72 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31295426 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2019.06.004 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=""Monte""/><ref name=""pmid21514796"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cushnie TP, Lamb AJ | title = Recent advances in understanding the antibacterial properties of flavonoids | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–107 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21514796 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.02.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1003263 }}</ref><ref name=""pmid31410034""/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mok N, Chan SY, Liu SY, Chua SL | title = Vanillin inhibits PqsR-mediated virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Food & Function | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 6496–6508 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32697213 | doi = 10.1039/D0FO00046A | hdl = 10397/88306 | s2cid = 220699939 }}</ref>  Examples of natural products with antivirulence activity include the flavonoid [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (which inhibits [[listeriolysin O]]),<ref name=""pmid21514796""/> the [[quinone]] tetrangomycin (which inhibits staphyloxanthin),<ref name=""pmid31410034"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue L, Chen YY, Yan Z, Lu W, Wan D, Zhu H | title = Staphyloxanthin: a potential target for antivirulence therapy | journal = Infection and Drug Resistance | volume = 12 | pages = 2151–2160 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31410034 | pmc = 6647007 | doi = 10.2147/IDR.S193649 }}</ref> and the [[sesquiterpene]] zerumbone (which inhibits ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' [[Bacteria#Movement|motility]]).<ref name=""pmid32463353"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim HR, Shin DS, Jang HI, Eom YB | title = Anti-biofilm and anti-virulence effects of zerumbone against ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' | journal = Microbiology | volume = 166 | issue = 8 | pages = 717–726 | date = August 2020 | pmid = 32463353 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.000930 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Immunoglobulin therapy===
{{Main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
Antibodies ([[anti-tetanus immunoglobulin]]) have been used in the treatment and prevention  of [[tetanus]] since the 1910s,<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA, Offit PA |author-link2=Walter Orenstein |author-link1=Stanley Plotkin |author-link3=Paul Offit|title=Vaccines|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1455700905|pages=103, 757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoigDQ6vdDQC&pg=PA103|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021821/https://books.google.ca/books?id=hoigDQ6vdDQC&pg=PA103|archive-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> and this approach continues to be a useful way of controlling bacterial disease.  The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[bezlotoxumab]], for example, has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] and [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] for recurrent [[Clostridium difficile infection|''Clostridium difficile'' infection]], and other monoclonal antibodies are in development (e.g. AR-301 for the adjunctive treatment of ''S. aureus'' [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]]).  Antibody treatments act by binding to and neutralizing bacterial exotoxins and other virulence factors.<ref name=""pmid31295426""/><ref name=""pmid30683453""/>

===Phage therapy===

[[Image: Phage injecting its genome into bacteria.svg|thumb|upright=0.74|right| Phage injecting its genome into a bacterium.  Viral replication and bacterial cell lysis will ensue.<ref name=Sulakvelidze/>]]
[[Phage therapy]] is under investigation as a method of treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy involves infecting bacterial pathogens with [[virus]]es. [[Bacteriophage]]s and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus, unlike antibiotics, they do not disturb the host organism's [[intestinal microbiota]].<ref name=""Gill, Franco, Hancock""/> Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and kill bacteria primarily during lytic cycles.<ref name=""Gill, Franco, Hancock""/><ref name=Sulakvelidze>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sulakvelidze A, Alavidze Z, Morris JG | title = Bacteriophage therapy | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 649–59 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11181338 | pmc = 90351 | doi = 10.1128/aac.45.3.649-659.2001 }}</ref> Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage that are able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain.<ref name=Sulakvelidze/> The high specificity of phage protects [[Mutualism (biology)|""good""]] bacteria from destruction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunne M, Rupf B, Tala M, Qabrati X, Ernst P, Shen Y, Sumrall E, Heeb L, Plückthun A, Loessner MJ, Kilcher S | display-authors = 6 | title = Reprogramming Bacteriophage Host Range through Structure-Guided Design of Chimeric Receptor Binding Proteins | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 1336–1350.e4 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31665644 | s2cid = 204967212 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.062 }}</ref>

Some disadvantages to the use of bacteriophages also exist, however. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and, prior to use, it may be prudent to identify genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing. In addition, the oral and [[intravenous|IV]] administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application. Also, there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Fecal microbiota transplants===
{{Main| Fecal microbiota transplant }}
[[Image: E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|upright=0.74|right|Fecal microbiota transplants are an experimental treatment for ''C. difficile'' infection.<ref name=""pmid31295426""/>]]
Fecal microbiota transplants involve transferring the full [[intestinal microbiota]] from a healthy human donor (in the form of [[feces|stool]]) to patients with [[Clostridium difficile infection|''C. difficile'' infection]].  Although this procedure has not been officially approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]], its use is permitted under some conditions in patients with antibiotic-resistant ''C. difficile'' infection.  Cure rates are around 90%, and work is underway to develop stool [[biobank|banks]], standardized products, and methods of [[Oral administration|oral delivery]].<ref name=""pmid31295426""/>

===Antisense RNA-based treatments===
{{see| Antisense RNA }}
Antisense RNA-based treatment (also known as gene silencing therapy) involves (a) identifying bacterial [[gene]]s that encode essential [[protein]]s (e.g. the ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' genes ''acpP'', ''lpxC'', and ''rpsJ''), (b) synthesizing single stranded [[RNA]] that is complementary to the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] encoding these essential proteins, and (c) delivering the single stranded RNA to the infection site using cell-penetrating peptides or [[liposome]]s.  The antisense RNA then [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridizes]] with the bacterial mRNA and blocks its [[Translation (biology)|translation]] into the essential protein.  Antisense RNA-based treatment has been shown to be effective in ''in vivo'' models of ''P. aeruginosa'' [[lung infection|pneumonia]].<ref name=""pmid31295426""/><ref name=""pmid30683453""/>

In addition to silencing essential bacterial genes, antisense RNA can be used to silence bacterial genes responsible for antibiotic resistance.<ref name=""pmid31295426""/><ref name=""pmid30683453""/>  For example, antisense RNA has been developed that silences the ''S. aureus'' ''[[mecA]]'' gene (the gene that encodes modified [[penicillin-binding protein]] 2a and renders ''S. aureus'' strains [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant]]).  Antisense RNA targeting ''mecA'' mRNA has been shown to restore the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to [[oxacillin]] in both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' studies.<ref name=""pmid30683453""/>

===CRISPR-Cas9-based treatments===
In the early 2000s, a system was discovered that enables bacteria to defend themselves against invading viruses.  The system, known as CRISPR-Cas9, consists of (a) an enzyme that destroys DNA (the [[nuclease]] [[Cas9]]) and (b) the DNA sequences of previously encountered viral invaders ([[CRISPR]]).  These viral DNA sequences enable the nuclease to target foreign (viral) rather than self (bacterial) DNA.<ref name=""pmid29358495"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Krupovic M, Forterre P | title = History of CRISPR-Cas from Encounter with a Mysterious Repeated Sequence to Genome Editing Technology | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 200 | issue = 7 | pages = e00580-17 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29358495 | pmc = 5847661 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00580-17 }}</ref>

Although the function of CRISPR-Cas9 in nature is to protect bacteria, the DNA sequences in the CRISPR component of the system can be modified so that the Cas9 nuclease targets bacterial [[antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] genes or bacterial [[virulence]] genes instead of viral genes.  The modified CRISPR-Cas9 system can then be administered to bacterial pathogens using plasmids or bacteriophages.<ref name=""pmid31295426""/><ref name=""pmid30683453""/>  This approach has successfully been used to [[Gene silencing|silence]] antibiotic resistance and reduce the virulence of [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'']] in an ''in vivo'' model of infection.<ref name=""pmid30683453""/>

In addition to developing new antibacterial treatments, it is important to reduce the [[selection pressure]] for the emergence and spread of [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s rely on [[immune]] modulation or augmentation.

35,Epigenome editing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenome_editing,"[[File:Epigenome editing.png|300px|thumb|A visual overview of how TALE proteins are used for epigenome editing.]]
'''Epigenome editing''' or '''Epigenome engineering''' is a type of genetic engineering in which the [[epigenome]] is modified at specific sites using engineered molecules targeted to those sites (as opposed to whole-genome modifications). Whereas gene editing involves changing the actual DNA sequence itself, epigenetic editing involves modifying and presenting DNA sequences to proteins and other DNA binding factors that influence DNA function. By ""editing” epigenomic features in this manner, researchers can determine the exact biological role of an epigenetic modification at the site in question.

The engineered proteins used for epigenome editing are composed of a DNA binding domain that target specific sequences and an effector domain that modifies epigenomic features. Currently, three major groups of DNA binding proteins have been predominantly used for epigenome editing: [[Zinc finger]] proteins, [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs)]] and nuclease deficient Cas9 fusions ([[CRISPR]]).

== General concept ==

Comparing genome-wide [[epigenetic]] maps with [[gene expression]] has allowed researchers to assign either activating or repressing roles to specific modifications. The importance of DNA sequence in regulating the epigenome has been demonstrated by using DNA motifs to predict epigenomic modification.<ref name=""Whitaker"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitaker JW, Chen Z, Wang W | title = Predicting the human epigenome from DNA motifs | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 265–72, 7 p following 272 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25240437 | pmc = 4344378 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3065 }}</ref> Further insights into mechanisms behind [[epigenetics]] have come from [[in vitro]] biochemical and structural analyses. Using [[model organism]]s, researchers have been able to describe the role of many [[chromatin]] factors through [[Gene knockout|knockout]] studies. However knocking out an entire chromatin modifier has massive effects on the entire genome, which may not be an accurate representation of its function in a specific context. As one example of this, [[DNA methylation]] occurs at [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat regions]], [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], and [[gene]] bodies. Although [[DNA methylation]] at gene promoters typically correlates with gene repression, methylation at gene bodies is correlated with gene activation, and DNA methylation may also play a role in gene splicing.<ref name=""Jones"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones PA | title = Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 484–92 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22641018 | doi = 10.1038/nrg3230 | s2cid = 3346812 }}</ref>   The ability to directly target and edit individual methylation sites is critical to determining the exact function of DNA methylation at a specific site. Epigenome editing is a powerful tool that allows this type of analysis. For site-specific DNA methylation editing as well as for histone editing, genome editing systems have been adapted into epigene editing systems. In short, genome homing proteins with engineered or naturally occurring nuclease functions for gene editing, can be mutated and adapted into purely delivery systems. An epigenetic modifying enzyme or domain can be fused to the homing protein and local epigenetic modifications can be altered upon protein recruitment.

=== Targeting proteins ===

==== TALE ====

The [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE)]] protein recognizes specific DNA sequences based on the composition of its [[DNA binding domain]].<ref name=""Gaj"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaj T, Gersbach CA, Barbas CF | title = ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 397–405 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664777 | pmc = 3694601 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004 }}</ref>  This allows the researcher to construct different TALE proteins to recognize a target DNA sequence by editing the TALE's primary protein structure. The binding specificity of this protein is then typically confirmed using [[Chromatin Immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) and [[Sanger sequencing]] of the resulting DNA fragment.<ref name=""Konermann"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Konermann S, Brigham MD, Trevino A, Hsu PD, Heidenreich M, Cong L, Platt RJ, Scott DA, Church GM, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Optical control of mammalian endogenous transcription and epigenetic states | journal = Nature | volume = 500 | issue = 7463 | pages = 472–476 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23877069 | pmc = 3856241 | doi = 10.1038/nature12466 | bibcode = 2013Natur.500..472K }}</ref><ref name=""Maeder"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maeder ML, Angstman JF, Richardson ME, Linder SJ, Cascio VM, Tsai SQ, Ho QH, Sander JD, Reyon D, Bernstein BE, Costello JF, Wilkinson MF, Joung JK | display-authors = 6 | title = Targeted DNA demethylation and activation of endogenous genes using programmable TALE-TET1 fusion proteins | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 1137–42 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24108092 | pmc = 3858462 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2726 }}</ref><ref name=""Mendenhall"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendenhall EM, Williamson KE, Reyon D, Zou JY, Ram O, Joung JK, Bernstein BE | title = Locus-specific editing of histone modifications at endogenous enhancers | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 1133–6 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24013198 | pmc = 3858395 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2701 }}</ref> This confirmation is still required on all TALE sequence recognition research.<ref name=""Voigt"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt P, Reinberg D | title = Epigenome editing | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 1097–9 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24316647 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2756 | s2cid = 28191072 }}</ref>
When used for epigenome editing, these DNA binding proteins are attached to an effector protein. Effector proteins that have been used for this purpose include [[TET1|Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)]],<ref name=""Maeder"" /> [[LSD1|Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1)]]<ref name=""Mendenhall"" /> and [[CIB1|Calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1)]].<ref name=""Konermann"" />

==== Zinc finger proteins ====

The use of [[zinc finger]]-fusion proteins to recognize sites for epigenome editing has been explored as well. Maeder et al. has constructed a ZF-TET1 protein for use in DNA demethylation.<ref name=""Maeder"" /> These zinc finger proteins work similarly to [[TAL effector|TALE proteins]] in that they are able to bind to sequence specific sites in on the DNA based on their protein structure which can be modified. Chen et al. have successfully used a zinc finger DNA binding domain coupled with the [[TET1]] protein to induce demethylation of several previously silenced genes.<ref name=""Chen"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen H, Kazemier HG, de Groote ML, Ruiters MH, Xu GL, Rots MG | title = Induced DNA demethylation by targeting Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 to the human ICAM-1 promoter | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 1563–74 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24194590 | pmc = 3919596 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1019 }}</ref> Kungulovski and Jeltsch successfully used ZFP-guided deposition of DNA methylation gene to cause gene silencing but the DNA methylation and silencing were lost when the trigger signal stopped.

This chimera is frequently referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). When the Cas9 protein associates with a DNA region-specific gRNA, the Cas9 cleaves DNA at targeted DNA loci. However, when the D10A and H840A point mutations are introduced, a catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is generated that can bind DNA but will not cleave.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/|title=Addgene: CRISPR/Cas9 Guide|website=www.addgene.org|access-date=2016-06-07}}</ref> The dCas9 system has been utilized for targeted epigenetic reprogramming in order to introduce site-specific DNA methylation.

=== Commonly used effector proteins ===

[[TET1]] induces demethylation of cytosine at [[CpG sites]]. This protein has been used to activate genes that are repressed by CpG methylation and to determine the role of individual CpG methylation sites.<ref name=""Maeder"" /> [[LSD1]] induces the demethylation of [[H3K4me1]]/2, which also causes an indirect effect of deacetylation on H3K27. This effector can be used on [[histones]] in enhancer regions, which can changes the expression of neighboring genes.<ref name=""Mendenhall"" /> [[CIB1]] is a light sensitive [[cryptochrome]], this cryptochrome is fused to the TALE protein. A second protein contains an interaction partner ([[CRY2]]) fused with a [[chromatin]]/DNA modifier (ex. [[SID4X]]). [[CRY2]] is able to interact with [[CIB1]] when the cryptochrome has been activated by illumination with blue light.<ref name=""Liu"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Yu X, Li K, Klejnot J, Yang H, Lisiero D, Lin C | title = Photoexcited CRY2 interacts with CIB1 to regulate transcription and floral initiation in Arabidopsis | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5907 | pages = 1535–9 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18988809 | doi = 10.1126/science.1163927 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1535L | s2cid = 3003167 }}</ref> The interaction allows the chromatin modifier to act on the desired location. This means that the modification can be performed in an inducible and reversible manner, which reduces long-term secondary effects that would be caused by constitutive epigenetic modification.<ref name=""Konermann"" />

== Applications ==

=== Studying enhancer function and activity ===

Editing of gene enhancer regions in the genome through targeted epigenetic modification has been demonstrated by Mendenhall et al. (2013).<ref name=""Mendenhall"" /> This study utilized a TALE-LSD1 effector fusion protein in order to target enhancers of genes, to induce enhancer silencing in order to deduce enhancer activity and gene control. Targeting specific enhancers followed by locus specific [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] allows for the genes affected by the silenced enhancer to be determined. Alternatively, inducing enhancer silencing in regions upstream of genes allows for gene expression to be altered. [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] can then be utilized to study effects of this on gene expression. This allows for enhancer function and activity to be studied in detail.<ref name=""Mendenhall"" />

=== Determining the function of specific methylation sites ===

It is important to understand the role specific methylation sites play regulating in gene expression. To study this, one research group used a TALE-TET1 fusion protein to demethylate a single CpG methylation site.<ref name=""Maeder"" /> Although this approach requires many controls to ensure specific binding to target loci, a properly performed study using this approach can determine the biological function of a specific CpG methylation site.<ref name=""Maeder"" />

=== Determining the role of epigenetic modifications directly ===

Epigenetic editing using an inducible mechanism offers a wide array of potential use to study epigenetic effects in various states. One research group employed an [[optogenetic]] two-hybrid system which integrated the sequence specific TALE DNA-binding domain with a light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein ([[CIB1]]).<ref name=""Konermann"" /> Once expressed in the cells, the system was able to inducibly edit histone modifications and determine their function in a specific context.<ref name=""Konermann"" />

== Limitations ==

Sequence specificity is critically important in epigenome editing and must be carefully verified (this can be done using [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] followed by [[Sanger sequencing]] to verify the targeted sequence).<ref name=""Voigt"" /> It is unknown if the TALE fusion may cause effects on the catalytic activity of the epigenome modifier. This could be especially important in effector proteins that require multiple subunits and complexes such as the [[Polycomb]] repressive complex.<ref name=""Voigt"" /> Proteins used for epigenome editing may obstruct ligands and substrates at the target site.<ref name=""Voigt"" /> The TALE protein itself may even compete with [[transcription factors]] if they are targeted to the same sequence.<ref name=""Voigt"" /> In addition, DNA repair systems could reverse the alterations on the chromatin and prevent the desired changes from being made.<ref name=""Voigt"" /> It is therefore necessary for fusion constructs and targeting mechanisms to be optimized for reliable and repeatable epigenome editing.

==Etymology==
''Candida albicans'' can be seen as a [[tautology (language)|tautology]]. Candida comes from the Latin word candidus, meaning white. Albicans itself is the present participle of the Latin word albicō, meaning becoming white. This leads to white becoming white, making it a tautology.

It is often shortly referred to as thrush, candidiasis, or candida.
More than a hundred synonyms have been used to describe ''C. albicans''.<ref name=""The yeasts"">{{cite book|title=The yeasts, a taxonomic study|date=1998|isbn=978-0444813121|edition=4|last1=Kurtzman|first1=C. P.|last2=Fell|first2=Jack W.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Simi|first1=Vincent|title=Origin of the Names of Species of Candida|url=http://www.antimicrobe.org/h04c.files/history/candida-history.pdf}}</ref>
Over 200 species have been described within the candida genus. The oldest reference to thrush, most likely caused by ''C. albicans'', dates back to 400 BCE in [[Hippocrates]]' work ''Of the Epidemics'' describing oral candidiasis.<ref name=""The yeasts""/><ref>{{cite web|last1=McCool|first1=Logan|title=The Discovery and Naming of Candida albicans|url=http://www.antimicrobe.org/h04c.files/history/DiscoveryNaming%20of%20CandidaAlbicans.pdf}}</ref>

[[File:Candida albicans PHIL 3192 lores.jpg|thumb|''Candida albicans'' growing on [[Sabouraud agar]]]]

The genome of ''C. albicans'' is almost 16Mb for the haploid size (28Mb for the diploid stage) and consists of 8 sets of chromosome pairs called chr1A, chr2A, chr3A, chr4A, chr5A, chr6A, chr7A and chrRA. The second set (''C. albicans'' is diploid) has similar names but with a B at the end. Chr1B, chr2B, ... and chrRB. The whole genome contains 6,198 [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs). Seventy percent of these ORFs have not yet been characterized. The whole genome has been sequenced making it one of the first fungi to be completely sequenced (next to ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'').<ref name=""Calderone""/><ref name=""candidagenome.org""/> All open reading frames (ORFs) are also available in [[Gateway Technology|Gateway-adapted vectors]]. Next to this ORFeome there is also the availability of a GRACE (gene replacement and conditional expression) library to study essential genes in the genome of ''C. albicans''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Roemer T, Jiang B, Davison J, Ketela T, Veillette K, Breton A, Tandia F, Linteau A, Sillaots S, Marta C, Martel N, Veronneau S, Lemieux S, Kauffman S, Becker J, Storms R, Boone C, Bussey H |s2cid=6773779 |date=2003l |title=Large-scale essential gene identification in Candida albicans and applications to antifungal drug discovery |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=38 |issue=19 |pages=167–81 |pmid=14507372 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03697.x|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=""ReferenceB"">{{cite web|url=http://www.candidagenome.org/CommunityNews.shtml|title=Candida Community News|website=www.candidagenome.org|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> The most commonly used strains to study ''C. albicans'' are the WO-1 and SC5314 strains. The WO-1 strain is known to switch between white-opaque form with higher frequency while the SC5314 strain is the strain used for gene sequence reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.candidagenome.org/Strains.shtml#P37005|title=Candida Strains|website=www.candidagenome.org|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref>

One of the most important features of the ''C. albicans'' genome is the high heterozygosity. At the base of this heterozygosity lies the occurrence of numeric and structural [[chromosome|chromosomal]] rearrangements and changes as means of generating genetic diversity by chromosome length polymorphisms (contraction/expansion of repeats), reciprocal [[chromosomal translocation|translocations]], chromosome [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], Nonsynonymous [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s and [[trisomy]] of individual chromosomes. These [[karyotype|karyotypic]] alterations lead to changes in the phenotype, which is an [[adaptation]] strategy of this fungus.

An unusual feature of the genus ''Candida'' is that in many of its species (including ''C. albicans'' and ''C. tropicalis'', but not, for instance, ''C. glabrata'') the CUG [[Genetic code|codon]], which normally specifies leucine, specifies serine in these species. This is an unusual example of a departure from the standard [[genetic code]], and most such departures are in [[start codon]]s or, for [[eukaryote]]s, [[genetic code#Variations|mitochondrial genetic codes]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ohama |first1=T |title=Non-universal decoding of the leucine codon CUG in several ''Candida'' species |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=21 |issue=17 |pages=1039–4045 |date=August 1993 |pmid=8371978 |pmc=309997 |doi=10.1093/nar/21.17.4039 |last2=Suzuki |first2=Tsutomu |last3=Mori |first3=Miki |last4=Osawa |first4=Syozo |last5=Ueda |first5=Takuya |last6=Watanabe |first6=Kimitsuna |last7=Nakase |first7=Takashi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.candidagenome.org/help/code_tables.shtml |title=CGD Help: Non-standard Genetic Codes |author1=Arnaud, MB |author2=Costanzo, MC |author3=Inglis, DO |author4=Skrzypek, MS |author5=Binkley, J |author6=Shah, P |author7=Binkley, G |author8=Miyasato, SR |author9=Sherlock, G |work=Candida Genome Database |access-date=30 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi#SG12 |title=The Alternative Yeast Nuclear Code |author=Andrzej (Anjay) Elzanowski and Jim Ostell |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) |location=Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A. |date=7 July 2010 |access-date=30 October 2011 |work=The Genetic Codes}}</ref> This alteration may, in some environments, help these ''Candida'' species by inducing a permanent stress response, a more generalized form of the [[heat shock response]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Santos, MA |author2=Cheesman, C |author3=Costa, V |author4=Moradas-Ferreira, P |author5=Tuite, MF |s2cid=28572737 |date=February 1999 |title=Selective advantages created by codon ambiguity allowed for the evolution of an alternative genetic code in ''Candida spp.'' |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=937–947 |pmid=10048036 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01233.x}}</ref> However, this different codon usage makes it more difficult to study ''C. albicans'' protein-protein interactions in the model organism ''S. cerevisiae''.

The genome of ''C. albicans'' is highly dynamic, contributed by the different CUG translation, and this variability has been used advantageously for molecular epidemiological studies and population studies in this species. The genome sequence has allowed for identifying the presence of a [[parasexual cycle]] (no detected [[meiosis|meiotic division]]) in ''C. albicans''.<ref name=Butler>{{cite journal |vauthors=Butler G, Rasmussen MD, Lin MF |title=Evolution of pathogenicity and sexual reproduction in eight ''Candida'' genomes |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7247 |pages=657–62 |date=June 2009 |pmc=2834264 |doi=10.1038/nature08064 |pmid=19465905 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2009Natur.459..657B}}</ref> This study of the evolution of sexual reproduction in six ''Candida'' species found recent losses in components of the major meiotic crossover-formation pathway, but retention of a minor pathway.<ref name=Butler/> The authors suggested that if ''Candida'' species undergo meiosis it is with reduced machinery, or different machinery, and indicated that unrecognized meiotic cycles may exist in many species. In another evolutionary study, introduction of partial CUG identity redefinition (from ''Candida'' species) into ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' clones caused a stress response that negatively affected sexual reproduction. This CUG identity redefinition, occurring in ancestors of ''Candida'' species, was thought to lock these species into a diploid or polyploid state with possible blockage of sexual reproduction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Silva RM, Paredes JA, Moura GR |title=Critical roles for a genetic code alteration in the evolution of the genus ''Candida'' |journal=EMBO J. |volume=26 |issue=21 |pages=4555–65 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17932489 |pmc=2063480 |doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601876 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==Morphology==
''C. albicans'' exhibits a wide range of [[morphology (biology)|morphologica]]l [[phenotype]]s due to phenotypic switching and bud to hypha transition. The yeast-to-hyphae transition (filamentation) is a rapid process and induced by environmental factors. Phenotypic switching is spontaneous, happens at lower rates and in certain strains up to seven different phenotypes are known. The best studied switching mechanism is the white to opaque switching (an epigenetic process). Other systems have been described as well. Two systems (the high-frequency switching system and white to opaque switching) were discover by [[David R. Soll]] and colleagues.<ref name=""auto"">{{cite journal|title=""White-opaque transition"": a second high-frequency switching system in Candida albicans.|journal=J.

In the 3153A strain, a gene called [[Sirtuin 2|''SIR2'']] (for silent information regulator), which seems to be important for phenotypic switching, has been found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pérez-Martín |first1=J |last2=Uría |first2=J A |last3=Johnson |first3=A D |title=Phenotypic switching in Candida albicans is controlled by a SIR2 gene. |journal=The EMBO Journal |date=4 May 1999 |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=2580–2592 |doi=10.1093/emboj/18.9.2580 |pmid=10228170 |pmc=1171338 |issn=0261-4189}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dean |first1=Laura |last2=McEntyre |first2=Johanna |title=How Candida albicans switches phenotype - and back again |date=24 November 1999 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2316/ |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information (US) |language=en}}</ref> ''SIR2'' was originally found in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (brewer's yeast), where it is involved in [[Gene silencing|chromosomal silencing]]—a form of [[transcriptional regulation]], in which regions of the [[genome]] are reversibly inactivated by changes in [[chromatin]] structure (chromatin is the complex of [[DNA]] and proteins that make [[chromosome]]s). In yeast, genes involved in the control of mating type are found in these silent regions, and ''SIR2'' represses their expression by maintaining a silent-competent chromatin structure in this region.<ref>[https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002200 SIR2 gene overview]</ref> The discovery of a ''C. albicans SIR2'' implicated in phenotypic switching suggests it, too, has silent regions controlled by ''SIR2'', in which the phenotype-specific genes may reside. How ''SIR2'' itself is regulated in ''S. cerevisiae'' may yet provide more clues as to the switching mechanisms of ''C. albicans''.

===White-to-opaque switching===

Next to the [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] and the first described high-frequency switching system ''C. albicans'' undergoes another high-frequency switching process called white to opaque switching, which is another [[phenotypic switching]] process in ''C. albicans''. It was the second high-frequency switching system discovered in ''C. albicans''.<ref name=""auto""/> The white to opaque switching is an [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] switching system.<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rikkerrink E, Magee B, Magee P |title=Opaque-white phenotype transition: a programmed morphological transition in Candida albicans |journal=J.

===White-GUT switch===
A very special type of phenotypic switch is the white-GUT switch (Gastrointestinally-IndUced Transition). GUT cells are extremely adapted to survival in the digestive tract by metabolic adaptations to available nutrients in the digestive tract. The GUT cells live as commensal organisms and outcompete other phenotypes. The transition from white to GUT cells is driven by passage through the gut where environmental parameters trigger this transition by increasing the WOR1 expression.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=23892606|doi=10.1038/ng.2710|title=Passage through the mammalian gut triggers a phenotypic switch that promotes Candida albicans commensalism|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=45|issue=9|pages=1088–91|year=2013|last1=Pande|first1=Kalyan|last2=Chen|first2=Changbin|last3=Noble|first3=Suzanne M|pmc=3758371}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27867199|pmc=5957277|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.157|title=Candida albicans cell-type switching and functional plasticity in the mammalian host|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=96–108|year=2016|last1=Noble|first1=Suzanne M.|last2=Gianetti|first2=Brittany A.|last3=Witchley|first3=Jessica N.}}</ref>

Candidiasis is known to cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms particularly in immunocompromised patients or those receiving steroids (e.g. to treat [[asthma]]) or antibiotics. Recently, there is an emerging literature that an overgrowth of fungus in the small intestine of non-immunocompromised subjects may cause unexplained GI symptoms. Small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO) is characterized by the presence of an excessive number of fungal organisms in the small intestine associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas. The underlying mechanism(s) that predisposes to SIFO is unclear. Further studies are needed; both to confirm these observations and to examine the clinical relevance of fungal overgrowth.<ref name=""SIFO""/><ref name=""pmid24789109"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Martins N, Ferreira IC, Barros L, Silva S, Henriques M |title=Candidiasis: predisposing factors, prevention, diagnosis and alternative treatment |journal=Mycopathologia |volume=177 |issue=5–6 |pages=223–240 |date=June 2014 |pmid=24789109 |doi=10.1007/s11046-014-9749-1 |quote=Candida species and other microorganisms are involved in this complicated fungal infection, but Candida albicans continues to be the most prevalent.

===Systemic infections===

Systemic fungal infections ([[fungemia]]s) including those by ''C. albicans'' have emerged as important causes of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] in [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients (e.g., [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], cancer [[chemotherapy]], organ or [[bone marrow]] transplantation). ''C. albicans'' often forms biofilms inside the body. Such ''C. albicans'' [[biofilm]]s may form on the surface of implantable medical devices or organs.

===Economic implications===
Given the fact that candidiasis is the fourth- (to third-) most frequent hospital acquired infection worldwide it leads to immense financial implications. Approximately 60,000 cases of systemic candidiasis each year in the USA alone lead up to a cost to be between $2–4 billion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Uppuluri|first1=Priya|last2=Khan|first2=Afshin|last3=Edwards|first3=John E.|editor1-last=Prasad|editor1-first=Rajendra|title=Candida albicans: Cellular and Molecular Biology|date=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing AG|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-50408-7|page=6|chapter=Current Trends in Candidiasis}}</ref> The total costs for candidiasis are among the highest compared to other fungal infections due to the high prevalence.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1524-4733.2002.51108.x|pmid=11873380|title=The Direct Cost and Incidence of Systemic Fungal Infections|journal=Value in Health|volume=5|issue=1|pages=26–34|year=2002|last1=Wilson|first1=Leslie S.|last2=Reyes|first2=Carolina M.|last3=Stolpman|first3=Michelle|last4=Speckman|first4=Julie|last5=Allen|first5=Karoline|last6=Beney|first6=Johnny|doi-access=free}}</ref> The immense costs are partly explained by a longer stay in the intensive care unit or hospital in general.

==Biofilm development==

===Biofilm formation steps===
The biofilm of ''C. albicans'' is formed in four steps. First, there is the initial adherence step, where the yeast-form cells adhere to the substrate. The second step is called Intermediate step, where the cells propagate to form [[microcolony|microcolonies]], and germ tubes form to yield hyphae. In the maturation step, the biofilm biomass expands, the extracellular matrix accumulates and drug resistance increases. In the last step of biofilm formation, the yeast-form cells are released to colonize the surrounding environment (dispersion). Yeast cells released from a biofilm have novel properties, including increased virulence and drug tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCall |first1=Andrew D. |last2=Pathirana |first2=Ruvini U. |last3=Prabhakar |first3=Aditi |last4=Cullen |first4=Paul J. |last5=Edgerton |first5=Mira |title=Candida albicans biofilm development is governed by cooperative attachment and adhesion maintenance proteins |journal=NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes |date=23 August 2019 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=21 |doi=10.1038/s41522-019-0094-5 |pmid=31452924 |pmc=6707306 |language=en |issn=2055-5008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chandra |first1=J |last2=Kuhn |first2=DM |last3=Mukherjee |first3=PK |last4=Hoyer |first4=LL |last5=McCormick |first5=T |last6=Ghannoum |first6=MA |title=Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance. |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |date=September 2001 |volume=183 |issue=18 |pages=5385–94 |doi=10.1128/jb.183.18.5385-5394.2001 |pmid=11514524 |pmc=95423}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gulati |first1=M |last2=Nobile |first2=CJ |title=Candida albicans biofilms: development, regulation, and molecular mechanisms. |journal=Microbes and Infection |date=May 2016 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=310–21 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2016.01.002 |pmid=26806384 |pmc=4860025}}</ref>

===Zap1===
Zap1, also known as Csr1 and Sur1 (zinc-responsive activator protein), is a transcription factor which is required for the hypha formation in ''C. albicans'' biofilms. Zap1 controls the equilibrium of yeast and hyphal cells, the zinc transporters and zinc regulated genes in biofilms of ''C. albicans''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Finkel|first1=Jonathan S.|last2=Mitchell|first2=Aaron P.|date=2011|title=Genetic control of C. albicans biofilm development|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=9|issue=2|pages=109–118|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2475|pmid=21189476|issn=1740-1534|pmc=3891587}}</ref>

===Zinc===
Zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) is important for cell function of ''C. albicans'' and Zap1 controls the Zinc levels in the cells through the zinc transporters Zrt1 and Zrt2. The regulation of zinc concentration in the cells is important for the cell viability and if the zinc levels get too high, it is toxic for the cells. The Zrt1 is transporting the zinc ions with high affinity and the Zrt2 is transporting the zinc ions with low affinity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Claus|first1=Juliane|last2=Chavarría-Krauser|first2=Andrés|date=2012-06-08|title=Modeling Regulation of Zinc Uptake via ZIP Transporters in Yeast and Plant Roots|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e37193|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037193|pmid=22715365|pmc=3371047|issn=1932-6203|arxiv=1202.4335|bibcode=2012PLoSO...737193C|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Mechanisms and proteins important for pathogenesis==

===Filamentation===
The ability to switch between yeast cells and hyphal cells is an important virulence factor. Many proteins play a role in this process.
Filamentation in ''C. albicans'' is a very complex process.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Filamentation Involves Two Overlapping, but Distinct, Programs of Filamentation in the Pathogenic Fungus Candida albicans|doi=10.1534/g3.117.300224 |pmid=28951491 |pmc=5677161 |year=2017 |journal=G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics|volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=3797–3808 |last1= Azadmanesh |first1= Jahaun |last2= Gowen |first2= Austin M. |last3= Creger |first3= Paul E. |last4= Schafer |first4= Nichole D. |last5= Blankenship |first5= Jill R.}}</ref> The formation of hyphae can for example help ''Candida albicans'' to escape from macrophages in the human body.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Transcriptional Response of Candida albicans upon Internalization by Macrophages|journal=Eukaryotic Cell|volume=3|issue=5|pages=1076–87|doi=10.1128/EC.3.5.1076-1087.2004|pmid=15470236|year=2004|last1=Lorenz|first1=M.

===Hwp1===
{{Main|Hwp1}}
Hwp1 stands for Hyphal wall protein 1. Hwp1 is a mannoprotein located on the surface of the hyphae in the hyphal form of ''C. albicans''. Hwp1 is a mammalian [[transglutaminase]] substrate. This host enzyme allows ''Candida albicans'' to [[fungal adhesin|attach]] stably to host epithelial cells.<ref name=""Staab1999"">{{cite journal |last1=Staab |first1=J.

==Genetic and genomic tools==

Due to its nature as a model organism, being an important human pathogen and the alternative codon usage (CUG translated into serine rather than leucine), several specific projects and tools have been created to study ''C. albicans''.<ref name=""Calderone""/> The diploid nature and the absence of a sexual cycle, however, makes it a hard to study organism. In the last 20 years, however, many systems have been developed to study ''C. albicans'' in a more in depth genetic level.<ref name=""Kabir""/>

===Selection markers===
The most used selection markers in ''C. albicans'' are the CaNAT1 resistance marker (confers resistance against [[nourseothricin]]) and MPAr or IMH3r (confers resistance to [[mycophenolic acid]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=CaNAT1, a Heterologous Dominant Selectable Marker for Transformation of Candida albicans and Other Pathogenic Candida Species|journal=Infection and Immunity|volume=73|issue=2|pages=1239–42|doi=10.1128/IAI.73.2.1239-1242.2005|pmid=15664973|year=2005|last1=Shen|first1=J|last2=Guo|first2=W|last3=Kohler|first3=J. R|pmc=547112}}</ref>
Next to the above-mentioned selection makers a few auxotrophic strains were generated to work with auxotrophic makers. The [[URA3]] marker (URA3 blaster method) is an often-used strategy in uridine auxotrophic strains; however, studies have shown that differences in URA3 position in the genome can be involved in the pathogeny of ''C. albicans''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the Roles of Four Candida albicans Genes in Virulence by Using Gene Disruption Strains That Express URA3 from the Native Locus|journal=Infection and Immunity|volume=71|issue=10|pages=6101–3|doi=10.1128/IAI.71.10.6101-6103.2003|pmid=14500538|year=2003|last1=Cheng|first1=S|last2=Nguyen|first2=M.

J|pmc=201070}}</ref> Besides the URA3 selection one can also use the histidine, leucine and arginine autotrophy. The advantage of using those autotrophies lies in the fact that they exhibit wild-type or nearly wild-type virulence in a mouse model compared to the URA3 system.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Strains and strategies for large-scale gene deletion studies of the diploid human fungal pathogen Candida albicans|journal=Eukaryotic Cell|volume=4|issue=2|pages=298–309|doi=10.1128/EC.4.2.298-309.2005|pmid=15701792|year=2005|last1=Noble|first1=S.

===Full sequence genome===

The full genome of ''C. albicans'' has been sequenced and made publicly available in a [http://www.candidagenome.org Candida database]. The heterozygous diploid strain used for this full genome sequence project is the laboratory strain SC5314. The sequencing was done using a whole-genome shotgun approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=van het Hoog |first1=Marco |last2=Rast |first2=Timothy J |last3=Martchenko |first3=Mikhail |last4=Grindle |first4=Suzanne |last5=Dignard |first5=Daniel |last6=Hogues |first6=Hervé |last7=Cuomo |first7=Christine |last8=Berriman |first8=Matthew |last9=Scherer |first9=Stewart |last10=Magee |first10=BB |last11=Whiteway |first11=Malcolm |last12=Chibana |first12=Hiroji |last13=Nantel |first13=André |last14=Magee |first14=PT |title=Assembly of the Candida albicans genome into sixteen supercontigs aligned on the eight chromosomes |journal=Genome Biology |date=2007 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=R52 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r52 |pmid=17419877 |pmc=1896002}}</ref>

===ORFeome project===

Every predicted ORF has been created in a gateway adapted vector (pDONR207) and made publicly available. The vectors ([[plasmid]]s) can be propagated in ''E.coli'' and grown on LB+[[gentamicin]] medium. This way every ORF is readily available in an easy to use vector. Using the gateway system it is possible to transfer the ORF of interest to any other gateway adapted vector for further studies of the specific ORF.<ref name=""ReferenceB""/><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-539-8_15 |pmid=22328378 |title=Host-Fungus Interactions - Modular Gene Over-expression Strategies for ''Candida albicans'' |volume=845 |pages=227–44 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |year=2012 |last1=Cabral |first1=Vitor |last2=Chauvel |first2=Murielle |last3=Firon |first3=Arnaud |last4=Legrand |first4=Mélanie |last5=Nesseir |first5=Audrey |last6=Bachellier-Bassi |first6=Sophie |last7=Chaudhari |first7=Yogesh |last8=Munro |first8=Carol A. |last9=d'Enfert |first9=Christophe |editor-first=Alexandra C. |editor-last=Brand |editor-first2=Donna M. |editor-last2=MacCallum |isbn=978-1-61779-538-1 |chapter=Modular Gene Over-expression Strategies for Candida albicans}}</ref>

===CIp10 integrative plasmid===

Contrary to the yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|''S. cerevisiae'']] episomal plasmids do not stay stable in ''C. albicans''. In order to work with plasmids in ''C. albicans'' an integrative approach (plasmid integration into the genome) thus has to be used. A second problem is that most plasmid transformations are rather inefficient in ''C. albicans''; however, the CIp10 plasmid overcomes these problems and can be used with ease to transform ''C. albicans'' in a very efficient way. The plasmid integrates inside the RP10 locus as disruption of one RP10 allele does not seem to affect the viability and growth of ''C. albicans''. Several adaptations of this plasmid have been made after the original became available.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045912 |pmid=23049891 |title=A Versatile Overexpression Strategy in the Pathogenic Yeast Candida albicans: Identification of Regulators of Morphogenesis and Fitness |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=e45912 |year=2012 |last1=Chauvel |first1=Murielle |last2=Nesseir |first2=Audrey |last3=Cabral |first3=Vitor |last4=Znaidi |first4=Sadri |last5=Goyard |first5=Sophie |last6=Bachellier-Bassi |first6=Sophie |last7=Firon |first7=Arnaud |last8=Legrand |first8=Mélanie |last9=Diogo |first9=Dorothée |last10=Naulleau |first10=Claire |last11=Rossignol |first11=Tristan |last12=d'Enfert |first12=Christophe |pmc=3457969|bibcode=2012PLoSO...745912C|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=""auto2"">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fgb.2008.10.012 |pmid=19032986 |title=Genome-wide analysis of Candida albicans gene expression patterns during infection of the mammalian kidney |journal=Fungal Genetics and Biology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=210–9 |year=2009 |last1=Walker |first1=Louise A. |last2=MacCallum |first2=Donna M. |last3=Bertram |first3=Gwyneth |last4=Gow |first4=Neil A.R. |last5=Odds |first5=Frank C. |last6=Brown |first6=Alistair J.P. |pmc=2698078}}</ref>

===Candida two-hybrid (C2H) system===

Due to the aberrant codon usage of ''C. albicans'' it is less feasible to use the common host organism (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') for [[two-hybrid screening|two-hybrid studies]]. To overcome this problem a ''C. albicans'' two-hybrid (C2H) system was created. The strain SN152 that is auxotrophic for leucine, arginine and histidine was used to create this C2H system. It was adapted by integrating a HIS1 reporter gene preceded by five LexAOp sequences.
In the C2H system the bait plasmid (pC2HB) contains the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' LexA BD, while the prey plasmid (pC2HP) harbors the viral AD VP16. Both plasmids are integrative plasmids since episomal plasmids do not stay stable in ''C. albicans''. The reporter gene used in the system is the ''HIS1'' gene. When proteins interact, the cells will be able to grow on medium lacking histidine due to the activation of the ''HIS1'' reporter gene.<ref name=""Calderone""/><ref name=""stynen""/> Several interactions have thus far been detected using this system in a low scale set up.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A CUG codon adapted two-hybrid system for the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans |journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=38|issue=19|pages=e184|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq725|pmid=20719741|pmc=2965261|year=2010|last1=Stynen|first1=Bram|last2=Van Dijck|first2=Patrick|last3=Tournu|first3=Hélène}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Legrand |first1=Mélanie |last2=Bachellier-Bassi |first2=Sophie |last3=Lee |first3=Keunsook K |last4=Chaudhari |first4=Yogesh |last5=Tournu |first5=Hélène |last6=Arbogast |first6=Laurence |last7=Boyer |first7=Hélène |last8=Chauvel |first8=Murielle |last9=Cabral |first9=Vitor |last10=Maufrais |first10=Corinne |last11=Nesseir |first11=Audrey |last12=Maslanka |first12=Irena |last13=Permal |first13=Emmanuelle |last14=Rossignol |first14=Tristan |last15=Walker |first15=Louise A |last16=Zeidler |first16=Ute |last17=Znaidi |first17=Sadri |last18=Schoeters |first18=Floris |last19=Majgier |first19=Charlotte |last20=Julien |first20=Renaud A |last21=Ma |first21=Laurence |last22=Tichit |first22=Magali |last23=Bouchier |first23=Christiane |last24=Van Dijck |first24=Patrick |last25=Munro |first25=Carol A |last26=d’Enfert |first26=Christophe |title=Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=6 July 2018 |volume=46 |issue=14 |pages=6935–6949 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky594 |pmid=29982705 |pmc=6101633 |language=en |issn=0305-1048}}</ref> A first high-throughput screening has also been performed.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A High-Throughput Candida albicans Two-Hybrid System |journal=mSphere |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.1128/mSphere.00391-18 |pmid=30135223 |pmc=6106057 |year=2018 |last1=Schoeters |first1=F |last2=Munro |first2=C.

===Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)===

Besides the C2H system, a [[bimolecular fluorescence complementation|BiFC]] system has been developed to study protein-protein interactions in ''C. albicans''. With this systems protein interactions can be studied in their native sub cellular location contrary to a C2H system in which the proteins are forced into the nucleus. With BiFC one can study for example protein interactions that take place at the cell membrane or vacuolar membrane.<ref name=""frontiersin.org""/><ref>{{cite journal|title=A Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Tool for Identification of Protein-Protein Interactions in Candida albicans|journal=G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics|volume=7|issue=10|pages=3509–3520|doi=10.1534/g3.117.300149|pmid=28860184|pmc=5633398|year=2017|last1=Subotić|first1=Ana|last2=Swinnen|first2=Erwin|last3=Demuyser|first3=Liesbeth|last4=De Keersmaecker|first4=Herlinde|last5=Mizuno|first5=Hideaki|last6=Tournu|first6=Hélène|last7=Van Dijck|first7=Patrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mamouei |first1=Zeinab |last2=Zeng |first2=Guisheng |last3=Wang |first3=Yan-Ming |last4=Wang |first4=Yue |title=Candida albicans possess a highly versatile and dynamic high-affinity iron transport system important for its commensal-pathogenic lifestyle |journal=Molecular Microbiology |date=2017 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=986–998 |doi=10.1111/mmi.13864 |pmid=29030877 |language=en |issn=1365-2958|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===GRACE library===

Using a [[tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation|tetracycline-regulatable promoter system]] a gene replacement and conditional expression (GRACE) library was created for 1,152 genes. By using the regulatable promoter and having deleted 1 of the alleles of the specific gene it was possible to discriminate between non-essential and essential genes. Of the tested 1,152 genes 567 showed to be essential. The knowledge on essential genes can be used to discover novel antifungals.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03697.x |pmid=14507372 |title=Large-scale essential gene identification in Candida albicans and applications to antifungal drug discovery |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=167–81 |year=2003 |last1=Roemer |first1=Terry |last2=Jiang |first2=Bo |last3=Davison |first3=John |last4=Ketela |first4=Troy |last5=Veillette |first5=Karynn |last6=Breton |first6=Anouk |last7=Tandia |first7=Fatou |last8=Linteau |first8=Annie |last9=Sillaots |first9=Susan |last10=Marta |first10=Catarina |last11=Martel |first11=Nick |last12=Veronneau |first12=Steeve |last13=Lemieux |first13=Sebastien |last14=Kauffman |first14=Sarah |last15=Becker |first15=Jeff |last16=Storms |first16=Reginald |last17=Boone |first17=Charles |last18=Bussey |first18=Howard|s2cid=6773779 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat were preferentially chosen by farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a toughened [[rachis]] during harvesting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=N|last2=Oliveira|first2=HR|last3=Fradgley|first3=N|last4=Corke|first4=F|last5=Cockram|first5=J|last6=Doonan|first6=JH|last7=Nibau|first7=C|title=μCT trait analysis reveals morphometric differences between domesticated temperate small grain cereals and their wild relatives|journal=The Plant Journal|volume=99|issue=1|pages=98–111|date=14 March 2019|doi=10.1111/tpj.14312|pmid=30868647|pmc=6618119 }}</ref> In wild strains, a more fragile rachis allows the ear to easily [[shattering (agriculture)|shatter]] and disperse the spikelets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Tanno|first1 = K Willcox|year = 2006|title = How fast was wild wheat domesticated?|journal = Science|volume = 311|issue = 5769|page = 1886|doi = 10.1126/science.1124635|pmid = 16574859|last2 = Willcox|first2 = G|s2cid = 5738581 }}</ref> Selection for these traits by farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply have occurred because these traits made gathering the seeds easier; nevertheless such 'incidental' selection was an important part of crop [[domestication]].

Remains of harvested emmer from several sites near the Karacadag Range have been dated to between 8600 (at [[Cayonu]]) and 8400&nbsp;BCE (Abu Hureyra), that is, in the [[Neolithic]] period. With the exception of Iraq ed-Dubb, the earliest carbon-14 dated remains of domesticated emmer wheat were found in the earliest levels of [[Tell Aswad]], in the [[Damascus]] basin, near [[Mount Hermon]] in Syria. These remains were dated by [[Willem van Zeist]] and his assistant Johanna Bakker-Heeres to 8800&nbsp;BCE.

From Asia, wheat continued to spread across Europe and to the [[Americas]] in the [[Columbian exchange]]. In the British Isles, wheat straw (thatch) was used for roofing in the Bronze Age, and was in common use until the late 19th century.<ref>Belderok B ''et al.''

White wheat bread was historically a high status food, but during the nineteenth century it became in Britain an item of mass consumption, displacing oats, barley and rye from diets in the North of the country.  It became a symbol of British global power and ""a sign of a high degree of culture"".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Otter|first1=Chris|title=Diet for a large planet|date=2020|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=USA|isbn=978-0-226-69710-9|page=50 }}</ref>

Technological advances in soil preparation and seed placement at planting time, use of [[crop rotation]] and [[fertilizer]]s to improve plant growth, and advances in harvesting methods have all combined to promote wheat as a viable crop. When the use of [[seed drill]]s replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century, another great increase in productivity occurred.

Yields of pure wheat per unit area increased as methods of crop rotation were applied to long cultivated land, and the use of fertilizers became widespread. Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included threshing machines, [[reaper-binder]] machines (the '[[combine harvester]]'), [[tractor]]-drawn cultivators and planters, and better varieties (see [[Green Revolution]] and [[Norin 10 wheat]]). Great expansion of wheat production occurred as new arable land was farmed in the Americas and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries.

{{anchor|Genetics|Breeding}}

== Genetics and breeding ==
In traditional agricultural systems wheat populations often consist of [[landrace]]s, informal farmer-maintained populations that often maintain high levels of morphological diversity. Although landraces of wheat are no longer grown in Europe and North America, they continue to be important elsewhere. The origins of [[crop breeding|formal wheat breeding]] lie in the nineteenth century, when single line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted to have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed in the first years of the twentieth century and was closely linked to the development of [[Mendelian genetics]]. The standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny. Selections are ''identified'' (shown to have the genes responsible for the varietal differences) ten or more generations before release as a variety or cultivar.<ref name=Bajaj />

Major breeding objectives include high grain yield, good quality, disease and insect resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral, moisture and heat tolerance. The major diseases in temperate environments include the following, arranged in a rough order of their significance from cooler to warmer climates: [[Eyespot (wheat)|eyespot]], [[Phaeosphaeria nodorum|Stagonospora nodorum blotch]] (also known as glume blotch), [[Wheat yellow rust|yellow]] or [[Wheat yellow rust|stripe rust]], [[Powdery mildew#Powdery mildew of wheat|powdery mildew]], [[Septoria tritici]] blotch (sometimes known as leaf blotch), [[Wheat leaf rust|brown]] or [[Wheat leaf rust|leaf rust]], [[wheat fusarium head blight|Fusarium head blight]], [[Pyrenophora tritici-repentis|tan spot]] and [[stem rust]]. In tropical areas, [[Spot blotch (wheat)|spot blotch]] (also known as Helminthosporium leaf blight) is also important.

Wheat has also been the subject of [[mutation breeding]], with the use of gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mvgs.iaea.org/|title=MVD|website=mvgs.iaea.org}}</ref> Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content has been developed through gamma radiation breeding,<ref>{{Cite journal

===Yields===
The presence of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Genes for the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by [[Norin 10 wheat|Japanese wheat breeders]] to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors in the success of the [[Green Revolution]] in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by [[Norman Borlaug]]. Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. ""Lodging"" occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy nitrogenous fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

[[F1 hybrid]] wheat cultivars should not be confused with wheat cultivars deriving from standard [[plant breeding]], which may descend from hybrid crosses further back in its ancestry. [[Heterosis]] or hybrid vigor (as in the familiar F1 hybrids of maize) occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, but it is difficult to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale as is done with maize because wheat flowers are perfect in the botanical sense, meaning they have both male and female parts, and normally [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]].<ref name=Bajaj>Bajaj, Y.P.S.

====Triticale: Wheat-rye hybrid====
[[File:Wheat, rye, triticale montage.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The smaller grain of wheat on the left, larger kernels of [[rye]] next, and triticale on the right – triticale grain is significantly larger than wheat.]]

In ancient times, wheat was often considered a luxury grain because it had lower yield but better taste and digestibility than competitors like rye. In the 19th century, efforts were made to hybridize the two to get a crop with the best traits of both. This produced [[triticale]], a grain with high potential, but fraught with problems relating to fertility and germination. These have mostly been solved, so that in the 20th century millions of acres of triticale are being grown worldwide.

==Varieties==
There are around 20 wheat varieties of 7 species grown throughout the world. In Canada different varieties are blended prior to sale. ""Identity preserved"" wheat that has been stored and transported separately (at extra cost) usually fetches a higher price.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Posner |first1=Elieser S. |title=Wheat flour milling |date=2011 |publisher=American Association of Cereal Chemists}}</ref>

Apart from mutant versions of genes selected in antiquity during domestication, there has been more recent deliberate selection of [[allele]]s that affect growth characteristics. Some wheat species are [[diploid]], with two sets of [[chromosome]]s, but many are stable [[polyploidy|polyploids]], with four sets of chromosomes ([[tetraploid]]) or six ([[hexaploid]]).<ref name=Hancock>Hancock, James F.

[[Einkorn]] wheat (''T. monococcum'') is diploid (AA, two complements of seven chromosomes, 2n=14).<ref name=Belderok />

Most tetraploid wheats (e.g. [[emmer]] and [[durum]] wheat) are derived from [[Emmer#Wild emmer|wild emmer]], ''T. dicoccoides''. Wild emmer is itself the result of a hybridization between two diploid wild grasses, ''[[Triticum urartu|T. urartu]]'' and a wild goatgrass such as ''Aegilops searsii'' or ''[[Aegilops speltoides|Ae. speltoides]]''. The unknown grass has never been identified among non-extinct wild grasses, but the closest living relative is ''Aegilops speltoides''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friebe |first1=B. |last2=Qi |first2=L.L. |last3=Nasuda |first3=S. |last4=Zhang |first4=P. |last5=Tuleen |first5=N.A. |last6=Gill |first6=B.S. |s2cid=13010134 |title=Development of a complete set of Triticum aestivum-Aegilops speltoides chromosome addition lines |journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics |date=July 2000 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=51–58 |doi=10.1007/s001220051448}}</ref> The hybridization that formed wild emmer (AABB) occurred in the wild, long before domestication,<ref name=Hancock /> and was driven by natural selection.

Hexaploid wheats evolved in farmers' fields. Either domesticated emmer or durum wheat hybridized with yet another wild diploid grass (''[[Aegilops tauschii]]'') to make the [[hexaploid]] wheats, [[spelt]] wheat and [[common wheat|bread wheat]].<ref name=Hancock /> These have ''three'' sets of paired chromosomes, three times as many as in diploid wheat.

=== Hulled versus free-threshing species ===

This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily on threshing.

The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.<ref name=Potts />

In free-threshing (or naked) forms, such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

{{details|Taxonomy of wheat}}
[[File:Wheat in sack.jpg|thumb|Sack of wheat [[grain]]s]]
[[File:Modell eines Korns von Triticum vulgare (Weizen) -Osterloh Nr. 138-.jpg|thumb|Model of a wheat grain, [[Botanical Museum Greifswald]]]]
There are many botanical classification systems used for wheat species, discussed in a separate article on [[wheat taxonomy]]. The name of a wheat species from one information source may not be the name of a wheat species in another.

Within a species, wheat cultivars are further classified by wheat breeders and farmers in terms of:
* Growing season, such as [[winter wheat]] vs. spring wheat.<ref name=CVDE>Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 1959.</ref>
* [[Protein]] content. Bread wheat protein content ranges from 10% in some soft wheats with high starch contents, to 15% in hard wheats.
* The quality of the wheat protein [[gluten]]. This protein can determine the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables [[dough]] to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The gluten protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.
* Grain color (red, white or amber). Many wheat varieties are reddish-brown due to phenolic compounds present in the bran layer which are transformed to pigments by browning enzymes. White wheats have a lower content of phenolics and browning enzymes, and are generally less astringent in taste than red wheats. The yellowish color of durum wheat and [[semolina]] flour made from it is due to a [[carotenoid]] pigment called [[lutein]], which can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.

=== Classes used in North America ===
The named classes of wheat in English are more or less the same in Canada as in the US, as broadly the same commercial cash crop strains can be found in both.

The classes used in the [[Wheat production in the United States|United States]] are:<ref>{{cite news|title=Flour types: Wheat, Rye, and Barley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/garden/flour-types-wheat-rye-and-barley.html|work=The New York Times|date=18 February 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Wheat: Background |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/wheat/background.aspx|publisher=USDA|access-date=2 October 2016}}</ref>
* '''[[Durum]]'''&nbsp;– Very hard, translucent, light-colored grain used to make [[semolina]] flour for pasta and [[bulghur]]; high in protein, specifically, gluten protein.
* '''Hard Red Spring'''&nbsp;– Hard, brownish, high-[[protein]] wheat used for bread and hard baked goods. Bread flour and high-gluten flours are commonly made from hard red spring wheat. It is primarily traded on the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]].
* '''Hard Red Winter'''&nbsp;– Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat used for bread, hard baked goods and as an adjunct in other flours to increase protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands of unbleached all-purpose flours are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is primarily traded on the [[Kansas City Board of Trade]]. Many varieties grown from Kansas south are descendant from a variety known as ""turkey red"", which was brought to Kansas by [[Mennonite]] immigrants from Russia.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moon | first1 = David | year = 2008 | title = In the Russian Steppes: the Introduction of Russian Wheat on the Great Plains of the UNited States | journal = Journal of Global History | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 203–25 | doi=10.1017/s1740022808002611}}</ref> [[Marquis wheat]] was developed to prosper in the shorter growing season in Canada, and is grown as far south as southern Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/marquis-wheat/| title = thecanadianencyclopedia.ca: ""Marquis Wheat""}}</ref>
* '''Soft Red Winter'''&nbsp;– Soft, low-protein wheat used for cakes, pie crusts, biscuits, and [[muffins]]. Cake flour, pastry flour, and some [[self-rising flour]]s with [[baking powder]] and salt added, for example, are made from soft red winter wheat. It is primarily traded on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].
* '''Hard White'''&nbsp;– Hard, light-colored, opaque, chalky, medium-protein wheat planted in dry, temperate areas. Used for bread and brewing.
* '''Soft White'''&nbsp;– Soft, light-colored, very low protein wheat grown in temperate moist areas. Used for pie crusts and pastry. Pastry flour, for example, is sometimes made from soft white winter wheat.

Red wheats may need bleaching; therefore, white wheats usually command higher prices than red wheats on the commodities market.

=== Nutrition ===

In 100 grams, wheat provides {{convert|1368|kJ|kcal|abbr=off}} of [[food energy]] and is a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of multiple [[essential nutrient]]s, such as [[protein]], [[dietary fiber]], [[manganese]], [[phosphorus]] and [[niacin]] (table). Several [[B vitamins]] and other [[dietary minerals]] are in significant content. Wheat is 13% water, 71% [[carbohydrate]]s, and 1.5% fat. Its 13% protein content is mostly [[gluten]] (75–80% of the protein in wheat).<ref name=shewry1 />

=== Comparison with other staple foods ===
The following table shows the nutrient content of wheat and other major staple foods in a raw form on a [[Dry matter#Dry matter basis|dry weight basis]] to account for their different water contents.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303184216/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |archive-date=3 March 2015 }}</ref>

Raw forms of these staples, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked as appropriate for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these staples is remarkably different from that of the raw form, as reported in this table.

In cooked form, the nutrition value for each staple depends on the cooking method (for example: baking, boiling, steaming, frying, etc.).

== Commercial use ==
[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]

Harvested wheat grain that enters trade is classified according to grain properties for the purposes of the [[commodity market|commodity-]] and [[international trade]] markets. Wheat buyers use these to decide which wheat to buy, as each class has special uses, and producers use them to decide which classes of wheat will be most profitable to cultivate.

Wheat is widely cultivated as a [[cash crop]] because it produces a good yield per unit area, grows well in a [[temperate climate]] even with a moderately short [[growing season]], and yields a versatile, high-quality flour that is widely used in [[baking]]. Most breads are made with wheat flour, including many breads named for the other grains they contain, for example, most [[rye]] and [[oat]] breads. The popularity of foods made from wheat flour creates a large demand for the grain, even in economies with significant food [[economic surplus|surpluses]].

In recent years, low international wheat prices have often encouraged farmers in the United States to change to more profitable crops.

=== Historical factors ===
====British Empire and successor states====
Wheat became a central agriculture endeavor in the worldwide [[British Empire]] in the 19th century, and remains of great importance in Australia, Canada and India.<ref> Alan Palmer, ''Dictionary of the British Empire and Commonwealth'' (1996) pp 193, 320, 338.</ref> In Australia, with vast lands and a limited work force, expanded production depended on technological advances, especially regarding irrigation and machinery. By the 1840s there were 900 growers in [[South Australia]]. They used the ""Ridley's Stripper"", to remove the heads of grain, and the reaper-harvester perfected by [[John Ridley (inventor)|John Ridley]] in 1843.<ref>Annie E. Ridley, ''A Backward Glance: The Story of John Ridley, a Pioneer'' (J. Clarke, 1904). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=B44WAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP21&dq=john+Ridley+australia+wheat&ots=eJ-EM2C8iE&sig=_K8J57jIeBidbge6drZOe-LIalM online]
</ref>  By 1850 South Australia had become the granary for the region; soon wheat farming spread to Victoria and New South Wales, with heavy exports to Great Britain. In Canada modern farm implements made large scale wheat farming possible from the late 1840s on. By the 1879s Saskatchewan was the center, followed by Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, as the spread of railway lines allowed easy exports to Britain. By 1910 wheat made up 22% of Canada's exports, rising to 25% in 1930 despite the sharp decline in prices during the worldwide [[Great Depression]].<ref>W. Hartley, and George E. Lee, ""Economic development of the Saskatchewan wheat economy.""

In the 19th century the American wheat frontier moved rapidly westward.  By the 1880s 70% of American exports went to British ports.  The first successful [[grain elevator]] was built  in Buffalo in 1842.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Otter |first1=Chris |title=Diet for a large planet |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-226-69710-9 |page=51 }}</ref>  The cost of transport fell rapidly.  In 1869 it cost 37 cents to transport a bushel of wheat from Chicago to Liverpool.  In 1905 it was 10 cents.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Otter |first1=Chris |title=Diet for a large planet |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-226-69710-9 |page=69 }}</ref>
====20th century====
In the 20th century, global wheat output expanded by about 5-fold, but until about 1955 most of this reflected increases in wheat crop area, with lesser (about 20%) increases in crop yields per unit area. After 1955 however, there was a ten-fold increase in the rate of wheat yield improvement per year, and this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to increase. Thus technological innovation and scientific crop management with [[Haber process|synthetic nitrogen fertilizer]], irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output growth in the second half of the century. There were some significant decreases in wheat crop area, for instance in North America.<ref>See Chapter 1, Slafer GA, Satorre EH (1999) ''Wheat: Ecology and Physiology of Yield Determination'' Haworth Press Technology & Industrial {{ISBN|1-56022-874-1}}.</ref>

Better seed storage and germination ability (and hence a smaller requirement to retain harvested crop for next year's seed) is another 20th-century technological innovation. In Medieval England, farmers saved one-quarter of their wheat harvest as seed for the next crop, leaving only three-quarters for food and feed consumption. By 1999, the global average seed use of wheat was about 6% of output.
====21st century====
Several factors are currently slowing the rate of global expansion of wheat production: population growth rates are falling while wheat yields continue to rise. There is evidence, however, that rising temperatures associated with [[Global warming|climate change]] are reducing wheat yield in several locations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Asseng|first1=S.|last2=Ewert|first2=F.|last3=Martre|first3=P.|last4=Rötter|first4=R.

=== Farming systems ===

In 2014, the most productive [[crop yield]]s for wheat were in Ireland, producing 10 tonnes per hectare.<ref name=fao-prod2014 /> In addition to gaps in farming system technology and knowledge, some large wheat grain-producing countries have significant losses after harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmers' inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. Various studies in India, for example, have concluded that about 10% of total wheat production is lost at farm level, another 10% is lost because of poor storage and road networks, and additional amounts lost at the retail level.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Economic Analysis of Post-harvest Losses in Food Grains in India: A Case Study of Karnataka| authors=Basavaraja H, Mahajanashetti SB, Udagatti NC|journal=Agricultural Economics Research Review|volume=20|pages=117–26|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/47429/2/8.pdf|year=2007}}</ref>

In the [[Punjab region]] of the Indian subcontinent, as well as North China, irrigation has been a major contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare.<ref name=godfray /> In developing countries, use of (mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300&nbsp;mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This is achieved by 'rotation cropping' (traditionally called the ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a [[canola]] crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%.<ref>{{cite web|author=Swaminathan MS|date=2004|url=http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/plenary/0/2159_swaminathan.htm|title=Stocktake on cropping and crop science for a diverse planet|publisher=Proceedings of the 4th International Crop Science Congress, Brisbane, Australia}}</ref> In these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after harvesting and by minimizing tillage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grainscouncil.com/EMS/06_Nov_02_Production_Farming_Practices.pdf|title=Umbers, Alan (2006, Grains Council of Australia Limited) Grains Industry trends in Production – Results from Today's Farming Practices|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126000226/http://www.grainscouncil.com/EMS/06_Nov_02_Production_Farming_Practices.pdf|archive-date=26 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Geographical variation ===

There are substantial differences in wheat farming, trading, policy, sector growth, and wheat uses in different regions of the world. The [[List of countries by wheat exports|largest exporters]] of wheat in 2016 were, in order of exported quantities: Russian Federation (25.3 million tonnes), United States (24.0 million tonnes), Canada (19.7 million tonnes), France (18.3 million tonnes), and the Australia (16.1 million tonnes).<ref name=""fao-exp2016"">{{cite web|publisher=United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization, Statistics Division (FAOSTAT)|title=Crops and livestock products/World List/Wheat/Export Quantity/2016 (pick list)|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TP|date=2016|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> The largest importers of wheat in 2016 were, in order of imported quantities: Indonesia (10.5 million tonnes), Egypt (8.7 million tonnes), Algeria (8.2 million tonnes), Italy (7.7 million tonnes) and Spain (7.0 million tonnes).<ref name=fao-exp2016 />

In the rapidly developing countries of Asia and Africa, westernization of diets associated with increasing prosperity is leading to growth in ''per capita'' demand for wheat at the expense of the other food staples.<ref name=godfray />

=== Most productive ===
The average annual world farm yield for wheat in 2014 was 3.3 tonnes per hectare (330 grams per square meter).<ref name=fao-prod2014 /> Ireland's wheat farms were the most productive in 2014, with a nationwide average of 10.0 tonnes per hectare, followed by the Netherlands (9.2), and Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (each with 8.6).<ref name=fao-prod2014 />

=== Futures contracts ===
Wheat [[Futures contract|futures]] are traded on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], [[Kansas City Board of Trade]], and [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]], and have delivery dates in March (H), May (K), July (N), September (U), and December (Z).<ref>[[Wikinvest:List of Commodity Delivery Dates|List of Commodity Delivery Dates on Wikinvest]]</ref>

=== Crop development ===
Wheat normally needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, depending upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions ([[winter wheat]] lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management requires that the farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and [[Plant hormone|growth regulators]] are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1&nbsp;cm in size (Z31 on [[Zadoks scale]]). Knowledge of stages is also important to identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between [[anthesis]] and maturity, are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress.<ref>Slafer GA, Satorre EH (1999) ''Wheat: Ecology and Physiology of Yield Determination'' Haworth Press Technology & Industrial {{ISBN|1-56022-874-1}}. pp. 322–23

Several systems exist to identify crop stages, with the [[Feekes scale|Feekes]] and [[Zadoks scale]]s being the most widely used. Each scale is a standard system which describes successive stages reached by the crop during the agricultural season.

{{Main|Wheat diseases|List of wheat diseases}}
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10772 Rustaffected wheat seedlings.jpg|thumb|upright|Rust-affected wheat seedlings]]
There are many wheat diseases, mainly caused by fungi, bacteria, and [[viruses]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Abhishek|first=Aditya|date=11 January 2021|title=DISEASE OF WHEAT: Get To Know Everything About Wheat Diseases|url=https://agriculturereview.com/2021/01/disease-of-wheat-symptoms-and-management.html|access-date=29 January 2021|website=Agriculture Review|language=en-US}}</ref> [[transgenic plant|Plant breeding]] to develop new disease-resistant varieties, and sound crop management practices are important for preventing disease. Fungicides, used to prevent the significant crop losses from fungal disease, can be a significant variable cost in wheat production. Estimates of the amount of wheat production lost owing to plant diseases vary between 10 and 25% in Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muextension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/crops/g04319.htm |title=G4319 Wheat Diseases in Missouri, MU Extension |publisher=Muextension.missouri.edu |access-date=18 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227045640/http://muextension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/crops/g04319.htm |archive-date=27 February 2007 }}</ref> A wide range of organisms infect wheat, of which the most important are viruses and fungi.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2013.

The main wheat-disease categories are:
* Seed-borne diseases: these include seed-borne scab, seed-borne ''[[Stagonospora]]'' (previously known as ''Septoria''), [[common bunt]] (stinking smut), and [[loose smut]]. These are managed with [[fungicide]]s.
* Leaf- and head- [[blight]] diseases: Powdery mildew, [[Wheat leaf rust|leaf rust]], ''[[Septoria tritici]]'' leaf blotch, ''Stagonospora'' (''Septoria'') nodorum leaf and glume blotch, and ''[[Fusarium]]'' head scab.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gautam | first1 = P. | last2 = Dill-Macky | first2 = R. | s2cid = 16596348 | year = 2012 | title = Impact of moisture, host genetics and ''Fusarium graminearum'' isolates on Fusarium head blight development and trichothecene accumulation in spring wheat | journal = Mycotoxin Research | volume =  28| issue = 1| pages =  45–58| doi = 10.1007/s12550-011-0115-6 | pmid = 23605982 }}</ref>
* Crown and [[root rot]] diseases: Two of the more important of these are '[[take-all]]' and ''[[Cephalosporium gramineum|Cephalosporium]]'' stripe. Both of these diseases are soil borne.
* Stem rust diseases: Caused by [[basidiomycete]] fungi e.g. [[Ug99]]
* Viral diseases: [[Wheat spindle streak mosaic virus|Wheat spindle streak mosaic]] (yellow mosaic) and [[barley yellow dwarf]] are the two most common viral diseases. Control can be achieved by using resistant varieties.

=== Animal pests ===
Wheat is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including [[flame (moth)|the flame]], [[rustic shoulder-knot]], [[setaceous Hebrew character]] and [[turnip moth]].
Early in the season, many species of birds, including the [[long-tailed widowbird]], and rodents feed upon wheat crops. These animals can cause significant damage to a crop by digging up and eating newly planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop late in the season by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in cereals amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and damage to wheat by various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception.<ref>[http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea210.html Biological Control of Stored-Product Pests. Biological Control News Volume II, Number 10 October 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615060931/http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea210.html |date=15 June 2010 }}
* [http://www.fao.org/inpho/content/compend/allintro.htm Post-harvest Operations Compendium, FAO.]</ref> Rodents can also cause major losses during storage, and in major grain growing regions, field mice numbers can sometimes build up explosively to plague proportions because of the ready availability of food.<ref>[http://www.cse.csiro.au/research/rodents/focus.htm CSIRO Rodent Management Research Focus: Mice plagues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721001101/http://www.cse.csiro.au/research/rodents/focus.htm |date=21 July 2010 }}</ref> To reduce the amount of wheat lost to post-harvest pests, [[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists have developed an ""insect-o-graph,"" which can detect insects in wheat that are not visible to the naked eye. The device uses electrical signals to detect the insects as the wheat is being milled. The new technology is so precise that it can detect 5–10 infested seeds out of 30,000 good ones.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:DE Mutations.png|thumb|Types of mutations that can be introduced by random, site-directed, combinatorial, or insertional mutagenesis.]]

In [[molecular biology]], '''mutagenesis''' is an important laboratory technique whereby [[DNA]] mutations are deliberately [[genetic engineering|engineered]] to produce [[Library (biology)|libraries]] of mutant genes, proteins, strains of bacteria, or other [[genetically modified organism]]s. The various constituents of a gene, as well as its regulatory elements and its gene products, may be mutated so that the functioning of a genetic locus, process, or product can be examined in detail. The mutation may produce mutant proteins with interesting properties or enhanced or novel functions that may be of commercial use. Mutant strains may also be produced that have practical application or allow the molecular basis of a particular cell function to be investigated.

Many methods of mutagenesis exist today. Initially, the kind of mutations artificially induced in the laboratory were entirely random using mechanisms such as UV irradiation. Random mutagenesis cannot target specific regions or sequences of the genome; however, with the development of [[site-directed mutagenesis]], more specific changes can be made. Since 2013, development of the [[CRISPR]]/Cas9 technology, based on a prokaryotic viral defense system, has allowed for the [[Genome editing|editing]] or mutagenesis of a genome ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Lander ES, Zhang F | title = Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 1262–78 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24906146 | pmc = 4343198 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010 }}</ref> Site-directed mutagenesis has proved useful in situations that random mutagenesis is not.

Early approaches to mutagenesis relied on methods which produced entirely random mutations. In such methods, cells or organisms are exposed to [[mutagen]]s such as UV radiation or mutagenic chemicals, and mutants with desired characteristics are then selected.

Similar procedures may be repeated with other types of cells and with different media for selection.

A number of methods for generating random mutations in specific [[protein]]s were later developed to [[Genetic screen|screen]] for mutants with interesting or improved properties.

==Site-directed mutagenesis==
{{main|Site-directed mutagenesis}}
Prior to the development site-directed mutagenesis techniques, all mutations made were random, and scientists had to use selection for the desired phenotype to find the desired mutation. Random mutagenesis techniques has an advantage in terms of how many mutations can be produced; however, while random mutagenesis can produce a change in single nucleotides, it does not offer much control as to which nucleotide is being changed.<ref name=""Bushman_2020""/> Many researchers therefore seek to introduce selected changes to DNA in a precise, site-specific manner.

[[File:Site Directed Mutagenesis.png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Simplified diagram of the site directed mutagenic technique using pre-fabricated oligonucleotides in a primer extension reaction with DNA polymerase]]
Current techniques for site-specific mutation originates from the primer extension technique developed in 1978. Such techniques commonly involve using pre-fabricated mutagenic oligonucleotides in a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] extension reaction with [[DNA polymerase]]. This methods allows for point mutation or [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] or [[Insertion (genetics)|insertion]] of small stretches of DNA at specific sites. Advances in methodology have made such mutagenesis now a relatively simple and efficient process.<ref name=""Doering_2018"" />

Newer and more efficient methods of site directed mutagenesis are being constantly developed. For example, a technique called ""Seamless ligation cloning extract"" (or SLiCE for short) allows for the cloning of certain sequences of DNA within the genome, and more than one DNA fragment can be inserted into the genome at once.<ref name=""Motohashi_2015""/>

Site directed mutagenesis allows the effect of specific mutation to be investigated. There are numerous uses; for example, it has been used to determine how susceptible certain species were to chemicals that are often used In labs. The experiment used site directed mutagenesis to mimic the expected mutations of the specific chemical. The mutation resulted in a change in specific amino acids and the effects of this mutation were analyzed.<ref name=""Doering_2018""/>

A segment may also be inserted randomly into the gene in order to assess structural or functional significance of a particular part of a protein.<ref name=""Parker_2011"" />

==Insertional mutagenesis==
{{further|Signature tagged mutagenesis|Transposon mutagenesis}}
The insertion of one or more base pairs, resulting in DNA mutations, is also known as insertional mutagenesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Uren AG, Kool J, Berns A, van Lohuizen M | title = Retroviral insertional mutagenesis: past, present and future | journal = Oncogene | volume = 24 | issue = 52 | pages = 7656–72 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16299527 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1209043 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Engineered mutations such as these can provide important information in cancer research, such as mechanistic insights into the development of the disease. Retroviruses and transposons are the chief instrumental tools in insertional mutagenesis. Retroviruses, such as the mouse mammory tumor virus and murine leukemia virus, can be used to identify genes involved in carcinogenesis and understand the biological pathways of specific cancers.<ref name=""Vassiliou_2010"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vassiliou G, Rad R, Bradley A | title = The use of DNA transposons for cancer gene discovery in mice | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 477 | pages = 91–106 | date = 2010-01-01 | pmid = 20699138 | doi = 10.1016/s0076-6879(10)77006-3 | publisher = Academic Press | series = Guide to Techniques in Mouse Development, Part B: Mouse Molecular Genetics | isbn = 9780123848802 | edition = 2nd | veditors = Wassarman PM, Soriano PM }}</ref> Transposons, chromosomal segments that can undergo transposition, can be designed and applied to insertional mutagenesis as an instrument for cancer gene discovery.<ref name=""Vassiliou_2010"" /> These chromosomal segments allow insertional mutagenesis to be applied to virtually any tissue of choice while also allowing for more comprehensive, unbiased depth in DNA sequencing.<ref name=""Vassiliou_2010"" />

Researchers have found four mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis that can be used on humans. the first mechanism is called enhancer insertion. Enhancers boost transcription of a particular gene by interacting with a promoter of that gene. This particular mechanism was first used to help severely immunocompromised patients I need of bone marrow. Gammaretroviruses carrying enhancers were then inserted into patients. The second mechanism is referred to as promoter insertion. Promoters provide our cells with the specific sequences needed to begin translation. Promoter insertion has helped researchers learn more about the HIV virus. The third mechanism is gene inactivation. An example of gene inactivation is using insertional mutagenesis to insert a retrovirus that disrupts the genome of the T cell in leukemia patients and giving them a specific antigen called CAR allowing the T cells to target cancer cells. The final mechanisms is referred to as mRNA 3' end substitution. Our genes occasionally undergo point mutations causing beta-thalassemia that interrupts red blood cell function. To fix this problem the correct gene sequence for the red blood cells are introduced and a substitution is made.<ref name=""Bushman_2020""/>

==Homologous recombination==
[[Homologous recombination]] can be used to produce specific mutation in an organism. Vector containing DNA sequence similar to the gene to be modified is introduced to the cell, and by a process of recombination replaces the target gene in the chromosome. This method can be used to introduce a mutation or knock out a gene, for example as used in the production of [[knockout mice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/homolrecomb.html |title=Homologous Recombination Method (and Knockout Mouse) |work=Davidson College }}</ref>

== CRISPR ==
{{main|CRISPR gene editing}}
Since 2013, the development of [[CRISPR]]-Cas9 technology has allowed for the efficient introduction of different types of mutations into the genome of a wide variety of organisms. The method does not require a transposon insertion site, leaves no marker, and its efficiency and simplicity has made it the preferred method for [[genome editing]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Seamless site-directed mutagenesis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome using CRISPR-Cas9 |author1=Damien Biot-Pelletier |author2=Vincent J.

== Gene synthesis ==
As the cost of DNA oligonucleotide synthesis falls, [[artificial gene synthesis|artificial synthesis of a complete gene]] is now a viable method for introducing mutations into a gene. This method allows for extensive mutation at multiple sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of a gene to optimise it for a particular organism.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yg3OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13 |title=Artificial DNA: Methods and Applications | veditors = Khudyakov YE, Fields HA |page=13 |publisher= CRC Press|date=25 September 2002|isbn=9781420040166 }}</ref>

'''Artificial transcription factors''' (ATFs) are engineered individual or multi molecule [[transcription factor]]s that either activate or repress gene [[transcription (biology)]].<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal|last1=Ansari|first1=Aseem Z|last2=Mapp|first2=Anna K|date=2002-12-01|title=Modular design of artificial transcription factors|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593102003770|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=765–772|doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00377-0|pmid=12470729|issn=1367-5931}}</ref>

ATFs often contain two main components linked together, a [[DNA-binding domain]] and a regulatory domain, also known as an effector domain or modulatory domain.<ref name="":0"" /> The DNA-binding domain targets a specific DNA sequence with high affinity, and the regulatory domain is responsible for activating or repressing the bound gene.<ref name="":0"" /> The ATF can directly regulate gene expression, can recruit proteins and other transcription factors to initiate transcription, or recruit proteins and other transcription factors to compact the DNA which inhibits [[RNA polymerase]] from binding and transcribing the DNA; an example of transcription factors up-regulating gene expression is displayed in figure 1 on the left.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last1=Heiderscheit|first1=Evan A.|last2=Eguchi|first2=Asuka|last3=Spurgat|first3=Mackenzie C.|last4=Ansari|first4=Aseem Z.|date=2018|title=Reprogramming cell fate with artificial transcription factors|journal=FEBS Letters|language=en|volume=592|issue=6|pages=888–900|doi=10.1002/1873-3468.12993|issn=1873-3468|pmc=5869137|pmid=29389011}}</ref>  Because ATFs are composed of two separable components, the DNA-binding domain and the regulatory domain, the two domains are interchangeable, permitting the design of new ATFs from existing natural transcription factors.<ref name="":0"" />

Some applications of ATFs include reprogramming cell state, cancer treatment, and a plausible treatment for Angelman Syndrome.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":5"" />

== ATF Design ==

=== DNA-Binding Domain ===
The DNA-binding domain routes the ATF to a specific gene sequence. Natural DNA binding proteins are commonly used because of their high affinity for their DNA target sequence, however currently no algorithm that matches the protein amino-acid sequence to the complementary DNA binding sequence exists, limiting the rational design of new DNA-binding proteins.<ref name="":0"" /> Non-peptide, oligonucleotide, and polyamide DNA-binding domains have recently been explored which permit rational design.<ref name="":0"" /> The type of DNA binding domain chosen depends on the desired application of the ATF, common DNA-binding domains are presented in Types of ATF DNA-Binding Domains section below.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" />

=== Regulatory Domain ===
The regulatory domain is responsible for activating or repressing the bound gene and accomplishes this regulation by either directly regulating gene expression or recruiting other proteins and transcription factors to change transcription levels.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> One route to upregulate a gene is for the ATF to recruit proteins that loosen the DNA wrapping around histones allowing [[RNA polymerase]] to bind and transcribe the gene; likewise, compacting the DNA would downregulate gene expression by inhibiting RNA polymerase from binding.<ref name="":0"" /> Regulatory domains promoting gene transcription are usually acidic activators, composed of acidic and hydrophobic amino acids, and regulatory domains repressing gene transcription usually contain more basic amino acids.<ref name="":0"" /> Factors influencing the effect the ATF has on transcription include the distance the regulatory domain is from the transcription site, the cell type, and the number of activating or repressing sequences present in the regulatory domain.<ref name="":0"" /> Activating domains, regulatory domains that promote gene transcription, are often capable of upregulating transcription by 5 to 40-fold and RNA regulatory domains have been shown to result in 100 fold transcription levels.<ref name="":0"" /> An alternative strategy for repressing genes is for the ATF to out-compete natural transcriptions factors and physically block transcription by RNA polymerase; however, creating ATFs with higher affinity for the DNA sequence than the natural transcription factors remains a challenge.<ref name="":0"" />

=== Linkers ===
Linkers covalently or non-covalently link the DNA-binding domain and regulatory domain.<ref name="":0"" /> Frequently, peptide linkers are used, but [[polyethylene glycol]] and small molecules linkers also exist.<ref name="":0"" /> The linkers enable the DNA-binding domains and regulatory domains to be interchangeable allowing the design of new ATFs from natural transcription factor components.<ref name="":0"" /> Although linkers are less studied, the linker length is important because it alters the extent of impact the regulatory domain has on gene expression.<ref name="":0"" />

=== History ===
Most ATFs have been constructed by exchanging existing DNA-binding domains and regulatory domains to generate ATFs with new targeting sites and transcription regulation consequences.<ref name="":0"" /> Designed DNA-binding domains, such as CRISPR-Cas, with new targeting capabilities are being explored to engineer higher specificity and control potential side effects.<ref name="":1"" /> In the future, ATFs which can respond to physiological cues, only change transcription levels in a specific cell type, and can easily be delivered without the use of electroporation are of great interest.<ref name="":0"" />

== Types of ATF DNA-Binding Domains ==

=== CRISPR-Cas ===
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats - Cas ([[CRISPR]]-Cas) system has been extensively studied to target a specific DNA sequence using a single guide RNA (sgRNA).<ref name="":3"">{{Cite journal|last1=Nidhi|first1=Sweta|last2=Anand|first2=Uttpal|last3=Oleksak|first3=Patrik|last4=Tripathi|first4=Pooja|last5=Lal|first5=Jonathan A.|last6=Thomas|first6=George|last7=Kuca|first7=Kamil|last8=Tripathi|first8=Vijay|date=2021-03-24|title=Novel CRISPR–Cas Systems: An Updated Review of the Current Achievements, Applications, and Future Research Perspectives|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=22|issue=7|pages=3327|doi=10.3390/ijms22073327|issn=1422-0067|pmc=8036902|pmid=33805113|doi-access=free}}</ref> For ATF applications the CRISPR-Cas system is modified to inactivate the Cas enzyme's natural function and link a regulatory domain to the Cas enzyme.<ref name="":1"" /> The CRISPR-Cas system benefits from high specificity between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence and the simplicity of designing new sgRNAs; however, the CRISPR-Cas system requires a PAM sequence directly upstream of the target DNA site and the large size of the Cas protein hinders delivery into the cell.<ref name="":1"" />

=== TALEs ===
Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are peptide structures composed of repeating 34 amino acids long segments forming a peptide ranging in total length from 340 to 510 amino acids.<ref name="":1"" /> Each repeating segment folds into two alpha helices and amino acids at residue positions 12 and 13 in the repeating segment determines the DNA binding sequence.<ref name="":1"" /> The TALEs peptide has high specificity to the target DNA preventing secondary side effects, but this high specificity prevents the ATF from binding to multiple sites and requires a different ATF for each desired effect.<ref name="":1"" />

== ATF Applications ==

=== Reprogramming Cell State ===
Directing cell differentiation and reprogramming cell fate have traditionally been achieved via a mixture of transcription factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Takahashi|first1=Kazutoshi|last2=Yamanaka|first2=Shinya|date=March 2016|title=A decade of transcription factor-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2016.8|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=183–193|doi=10.1038/nrm.2016.8|pmid=26883003|s2cid=7593915|issn=1471-0080}}</ref> The field gained significant interest once four transcription factors Oct4/Sox2/cMyc/Klf4 were found to reprogram cells from a differentiated state into an [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] state similar to embryonic stem cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Qi|first1=Huayu|last2=Pei|first2=Duanqing|date=July 2007|title=The magic of four: induction of pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by Oct4, Sox2, Myc and Klf4|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/cr200759|journal=Cell Research|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=578–580|doi=10.1038/cr.2007.59|pmid=17632550|s2cid=9643825|issn=1748-7838}}</ref> Multiple ATFs composed of three zinc finger proteins linked together can each activate genes that eventually lead to the production of the Oct4 transcription factor in the cell, causing the cell to reprogram to an induced pluripotent state without the addition of external Oct4 transcription factors.<ref name="":1"" /> The change in cell state demonstrates that ATFs can replace traditional transcription factors in cell reprogramming.<ref name="":1"" />

=== Angelman Syndrome ===
Angelman syndrome is a neurological development disorder caused by the deactivation of the maternal UBE3A gene.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Wen-Hann|last2=Bird|first2=Lynne M.|date=December 2016|title=Angelman syndrome: Current and emerging therapies in 2016|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27860204/|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics.

=== Cancer ===
Abnormal gene expression is regularly associated with cancer and uncontrolled tumor growth, making ATFs a promising therapeutic for cancer treatment.<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=Chunhong|last2=Higgins|first2=Paul J.|date=2013-01-01|title=Drugging the undruggable: Transcription therapy for cancer|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Reviews on Cancer|language=en|volume=1835|issue=1|pages=76–85|doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.11.002|pmid=23147197|pmc=3529832|issn=0304-419X}}</ref> By linking 6 zinc fingers together in an ATF, the ATF only binds to an 18 base pair sequence containing smaller subsequences complementary to each zinc finger in the ATF, so the ATF is more specific than one zinc finger which only targets a specific 3 to 4 base pair sequence.<ref name="":5"" /> ATFs linked to the KRAB repressor regulatory domain decreases cancer cells' drug resistance to chemotherapy, and ATFs linked to activator domains can upregulate Bax gene expression causing cell apoptosis; however, these treatments remain in the early stages because of inadequate delivery methods.<ref name="":5"" />

The technique relies on engineered strands of RNA to recruit native ADAR enzymes to swap out different compounds in RNA. Developed by researchers at [[Peking University]] in 2019, the technique, some have claimed, is more efficient than the [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR gene editing technique]].<ref>{{cite news|vauthors=Murphy F, Walsh M|date=July 15, 2019|title=Peking University Scientists Pioneer New Gene-Editing Technology|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-07-17/peking-university-scientists-pioneer-new-gene-editing-technology-101440863.html|work=Caixin|access-date=August 25, 2020|archive-date=October 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028231748/https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-07-17/peking-university-scientists-pioneer-new-gene-editing-technology-101440863.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Initial studies have claimed that editing efiiciencies of up to 80% can be achieved.

As opposed to DNA gene editing techniques (e.g., using CRISPR-Cas proteins to make modifications directly to a defective gene), LEAPER targets editing messenger RNA (mRNA) for the same gene which is transcribed into a protein.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dai X, Blancafort P, Wang P, Sgro A, Thompson EW, Ostrikov KK | title = Innovative Precision Gene-Editing Tools in Personalized Cancer Medicine | journal = Advanced Science | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 1902552 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 32596104 | pmc = 7312441 | doi = 10.1002/advs.201902552 }}</ref> Post-transcriptional RNA modification typically involves the strategy of converting adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) since inosine (I) demonstrably mimics guanosine (G) during translation into a protein. A-to-I editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, whose substrates are double-stranded RNAs.<ref name=""biotech"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Qu L, Yi Z, Zhu S, Wang C, Cao Z, Zhou Z, Yuan P, Yu Y, Tian F, Liu Z, Bao Y, Zhao Y, Wei W | display-authors = 6 | title = Author Correction: Programmable RNA editing by recruiting endogenous ADAR using engineered RNAs | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 37 | issue = 11 | pages = 1380 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31554940 | doi = 10.1038/s41587-019-0292-y | doi-access = free }}</ref> Three human ADAR genes have been identified with ADAR1 (official symbol ADAR) and ADAR2 (ADARB1) proteins developed activity profiles.

This results in a change in which protein is synthesized during [[Translation (biology)|translation]].

==History==
The technique was discovered by a team of researchers at Peking University in [[Beijing]], China. The discovery was announced in the journal ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' in July 2019.<ref name=""doc"">{{cite web|url=https://www.docwirenews.com/docwire-pick/leaper-new-genetic-editing-approach-may-rival-crispr/|title=LEAPER: New Genetic Editing Approach May Rival CRISPR|vauthors=Carfagno J|date=July 23, 2019|website=Doc Wire News|access-date=August 25, 2020|archive-date=September 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925131445/https://www.docwirenews.com/docwire-pick/leaper-new-genetic-editing-approach-may-rival-crispr/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Applications==
Chinese researchers have utilized LEAPER to restore functional enzyme activity in cells from patients with [[Hurler syndrome]]. They have claimed that LEAPER could have the potential to treat almost half of all known hereditary disorders.<ref name=""doc""/>

Highly specific editing efficiencies of up to 80% can be achieved when LEAPER editing using arRNA151 is delivered via a plasmid or viral vector or as a synthetic [[oligonucleotide]], though this efficiency varied significantly across cell types.<ref name=""biotech"" />  Based on these preliminary results, LEAPER may have the most therapeutic promise with no production of functional protein but if a partial restoration of protein expression would provide therapeutic benefit. For example, in human cells with defective α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) expression in cells from patients with IDUA-defective Hurler syndrome, LEAPER resulted in a W53X truncation mutant of p53 being edited using arRNA151 to achieve a ""normal"" p53 translation and functional p53-mediated transcriptional responses.<ref name=""biotech"" />

===Comparison to CRISPR===
{{See also|CRISPR gene editing}}
LEAPER is analogous to [[CRISPR gene editing#RNA editing|CRISPR Cas-13]] in that it targets RNA before proteins are synthesized. However, LEAPER is simpler and more efficient as it only requires {{not a typo|arRNA}}, rather than Cas and a guide RNA.<ref name=""doc""/> According to the researchers who developed LEAPER, it has the potential to be easier and more precise than any CRISPR technique.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Metzl J |author-link=Jamie Metzl|date=2020|title=Hacking Darwin|pages=99–100|isbn=978-1492670094}}</ref>

LEAPER also eliminates health concerns and technical barriers arising from the introduction of exogenous proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Qu L, Yi Z, Zhu S, Wang C, Cao Z, Zhou Z, Yuan P, Yu Y, Tian F, Liu Z, Bao Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Leveraging Endogenous ADAR for Programmable Editing on RNA. | journal = bioRxiv | date = January 2019 | pages = 605972 | doi = 10.1101/605972 | s2cid = 145866788 }}</ref>

It has also been called more [[Bioethics|ethical]] as it does not change DNA and thus does not result in heritable changes, unlike methods using CRISPR Cas-9.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou Q, Zhang Y, Zou Y, Yin T, Yang J | title = Human embryo gene editing: God's scalpel or Pandora's box? | journal = Briefings in Functional Genomics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–163 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32101273 | doi = 10.1093/bfgp/elz025 }}</ref>

'''SCAR-less genome editing'''
Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering (no-SCAR) is an editing method that is able to manipulate the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') [[genome]]. The system relies on [[recombineering]] whereby [[DNA]] sequences are combined and manipulated through [[homologous recombination]]. No-SCAR is able to manipulate the ''E. coli'' genome without the use of the chromosomal markers detailed in previous recombineering methods. Instead, in this method, the λ-Red recombination system facilitates donor DNA integration while [[Cas9]] cleaves double-stranded DNA to counter-select against [[Wild type|wild-type]] cells. Although λ-Red and Cas9 genome editing are widely used technologies, the no-SCAR method is novel in combining the two functions; this technique is able to establish [[point mutation]]s, gene deletions, and short sequence insertions in several genomic loci with increased efficiency and time sensitivity.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal

Following λ-red operon activity induction, a linear, double-stranded [[Gene cassette|cassette]] encoding a [[selectable marker]], such as [[Antibiotic Resistance|antibiotic resistance]], is transformed into the cells in place of the target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].<ref name="":1"" /> This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction ([[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] around the inserted linear DNA that are [[Complementary DNA|complement]] to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A [[plasmid]] expressing [[flippase]] (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave [[Flippase recognition target|FLP recognition target]] sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene.<ref name="":1"" /> While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.

The λ-red system has also been optimized for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker can be incorporated into the DNA at the specific location of [[mutagenesis]]. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired [[mutation]] is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.<ref>{{Cite journal

The method of recombination detailed above is advantageous as it provides an alternative to the low-efficiency, laborious, and multi-step recombination processes using [[endonuclease]]s and [[ligase]]s. Therefore, λ-red recombination is more specific in terms of possible genomic alterations that are not governed by locations of [[restriction enzyme]] recognition sites. However, it also has many limitations. Multiple rounds of transformations can increase the risk of error and increase recombination time. Therefore, efficiency can be low (0.1–10% for point mutations; 10<sup>−5</sup>–10<sup>−6</sup> for insertions, deletions, or replacements) and requires long growth into workable colonies between transformations and recombinant selections. All together, this contributes to a lengthy and inefficient mutagenesis procedure for even single mutations.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Integrating λ-red and Cas9 recombination===
Reisch and Prather pioneered a technique that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for ''E. coli'' genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (''cas9'') is first transformed into ''E. coli'' cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene of interest in the form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transformed. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the ''E. coli'' genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the ''E. coli'' target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to ''E. coli'' genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.<ref name="":0"" />

This system is able to modify numerous genome locations rapidly. In instances when a small number of mutations are introduced into the genome, the time efficiency of no-SCAR is comparable to other methods. However, with a large number of alterations, this technique is superior.<ref name="":0"" />

Therefore, this method contributes to the cost-effectiveness and throughput of the no-SCAR system.

The no-SCAR technique uses a two-plasmid system; this is because co-transformation of both ''cas9'' containing plasmid and the sgRNA plasmid results in cell death. More specifically, the cell lethality is a consequence of Cas9 cleaving the ''E. coli'' DNA that matches the sgRNA. In order to circumvent this issue, multiple plasmids are used in order to maintain expressional control of both ''cas9'' and sgRNA.

The [[Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation|P<sub>TET</sub> promoter]] plays an integral role in the expression of both plasmids. It drives transcriptional expression of both the sgRNA of interest and ''cas9'' in the host cell upon induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In the absence of the inducer, the P<sub>TET</sub> promoter is repressed by the constitutively expressed [[TetR|tetracycline repressor protein]] (TetR). Therefore, the presence of TetR in the host cell prior to the introduction of both ''sgRNA'' and ''cas9'' is a measure to avoid cell lethality.<ref name="":0"" />

The first plasmid used in the pioneering work of Reisch and Prather is composed of: the ''cas9'' gene under the control of the P<sub>TET</sub> promoter; the ''tetR'' gene, which codes for tetracycline repressor protein, under control of a constitutive promoter; and the ''cm<sup>r</sup>'' gene for [[chloramphenicol]] resistance. It was observed that leaky expression of Cas9 occurred even without induction of the P<sub>TET</sub> promoter. Therefore, to avoid cell death, a [[Transfer-messenger RNA|transfer messenger RNA]] (ssrA) tag was included in the plasmid downstream of the ''cas9'' gene. In the event of leaky Cas9 expression, the C-terminal ssrA tag would be recognized by ClpP protease and degrade Cas9 to allow for better expressional control of the protein. Together, these components make up the pCas9cr4 plasmid and allow targeting of the host cell chromosome.<ref name="":0"" />

The second plasmid used in the no-SCAR method consists of: the sgRNA of interest expressed under the control of the P<sub>TET</sub> promoter; the three genes that make up the λ-red system (exo, bet, and gam) under the control of the [[PBAD promoter|P<sub>araB</sub> promoter]], which is induced by [[arabinose]]; and the gene conferring resistance to [[aminoglycoside]]s, such as [[spectinomycin]] and [[streptomycin]]. These components make up the pKDsg-XXX plasmid to facilitate λ-red mediated alterations of the ''E. coli'' genome, where -XXX denotes the targeted sequence to modify.<ref name="":0"" /> 	

In summary, theoretically, the plasmids for use in this method can be constructed to allow for absolute customization of the protocol. One stipulation is that each of the two constructed plasmids should have distinct selectable markers, such as genes conferring resistance to two different antibiotics, to allow for targeted selection and counterselection. Furthermore, the pCas9cr4 plasmid can be purchased from [[Addgene]] (ID 62655) for direct implementation into a no-SCAR recombination experiment, and the pKDsgRNA-p15 (ID 62656) and pKDsgRNA-ack (ID 62654) plasmids can also be purchased from Addgene.

===Transformations===
The next step in the no-SCAR protocol is to transform the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids and linear [[oligonucleotide]]s into the ''E. coli'' cells themselves. In order to achieve this, the cells are made to be electrocompetent; one such method, as used by Reisch and Pather, is using a [[glycerol]]/[[mannitol]] density step gradient, which is fast and simple.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> This allows for transformation through [[electroporation]] and introduction of the plasmids and DNA into the cells.

In order to increase [[transformation efficiency]], transformed cells are grown in [[Super Optimal Broth|super optimal broth]] to expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and sgRNA were expressed at the same time without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene.<ref name="":0"" /> Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.

To ensure the pCas9cr4 plasmid was first successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene ''cm<sup>r</sup>'', conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10<sup>−1</sup>, 10<sup>−2</sup>, and 10<sup>−3</sup> were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30&nbsp;°C and [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]], or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful [[mutant]]s using the miniaturized plating method described previously.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 [[Growth medium|minimal medium]] plates supplemented with glycerol, [[Chloroacetic acid|chloroacetate]] and [[Super Optimal Broth|SOC]] (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30&nbsp;°C for two nights.<ref name="":0"" /> After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the ''aada'' gene, and as a result were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.

Following successful recombination of the linear DNA to the target genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used as a result of the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37&nbsp;°C, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the ''E. coli'' cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37&nbsp;°C, they observed no colony formation on the [[Lysogeny broth|LB]] plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.<ref name="":0"" />

===Recombinations===
Oligonucleotides used for subsequent recombinations should follow several guidelines to help maximize success.<ref name="":4"">{{Cite journal

First, optimal oligo length for the transfected linear DNA should be between 60 and 90 [[base pair]]s. This guideline is based on previous observations that this length has the highest allelic replacement efficiency. Longer oligos are prone to forming [[Hairpin (genetics)|hairpin structures]] that are not only inhibitory, but also are more expensive to synthesize. Shorter oligos have lower hybridization energies, resulting in decreased stability of the oligo to the chromosomal target. Of this sequence, at least 15 base pairs should be homologous to the target sequence at both the 5’ and 3’ ends to provide sufficient oligo [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|annealing]].<ref name="":4"" />

Another consideration is the inclusion of phosphorothioate bonds. In a phosphorothioate bond, one of the non-bridging oxygens between [[nucleotide]] bases is replaced with a sulfur atom, changing the chemical properties. This modification is necessary in oligo design because it results in decreased susceptibility to exonuclease degradation. At maximum, four of these bonds should be situated near the 5’ end of the oligo.<ref name="":4"" /> Too many phosphorothioate bonds can be problematic; each modified site creates a [[Stereocenter|chiral center]], which can lead to a [[racemic mixture]] of isomers with varying characteristics and properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frey | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Sammons | first2 = R.D. | year = 1985 | title = Bond order and charge localization in nucleoside phosphorothioates | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4699| pages = 541–545 | doi=10.1126/science.2984773| pmid = 2984773 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Further optimization can be achieved by designing oligos that target the [[DNA replication|lagging strand]] in [[DNA replication]] because targeting the lagging strand results in a higher frequency of recombinants. In DNA replication, [[RNA]] primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that [[DNA polymerase]] is able to synthesize the strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. This discontinuous synthesis results in the lagging strand being more exposed which allows for easier beta-mediated annealing of the oligo to the target DNA than when compared to annealing to the leading strand.<ref name="":4"" />

Finally, the [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]] (MMR) machinery offers inherent protection to the cell against nucleotide base mismatch. Therefore, any mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides can be targeted by the MMR. There are several ways to avoid this. First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce mismatch repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other [[silent mutation]]s. Since silent mutations do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery.<ref>{{Cite journal

Cas9, with the guidance of the transformed sgRNA, identifies the ''E. coli'' complement target sequence and initiates a double strand break. One crucial aspect is that the target gene must be in close proximity upstream of the PAM sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal

Meanwhile, dimerized λ gam binds to the host RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases, inhibiting all of their known activities, which prevents degradation of the linear foreign DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = K | year = 1991 | title = λ Gam protein inhibits the helicase and χ-stimulated recombination activities of Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 173 | issue = 18| pages = 5808–5821 | doi=10.1128/jb.173.18.5808-5821.1991| pmc = 208314 | pmid=1653221}}</ref> λ exo binds to double stranded linear transformed DNA and processively degrades it in a 5’ to 3’ direction.

This process results in single stranded 3’ overhangs on the linear DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kovall | first1 = R. | last2 = Matthews | first2 = B.W. | year = 1997 | title = Toroidal Structure of λ-Exonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5333| pages = 1824–1827 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5333.1824 | pmid=9295273}}</ref> Subsequently, λ beta, a member of a recombinase family, binds to the 3’ overhangs and mediates annealing to the complementary ''E. coli'' DNA.

In summary, this protocol allows for almost unlimited genome targeting provided that one stipulation is considered: this method is limited to targeting ''E. coli'' sequences that are located directly upstream of a PAM NGG sequence, so experiments must be designed that accommodate this restriction.

===PCR screen===
Once colonies are selected, transformants are genotyped using allele specific PCR.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Newton |display-authors=etal  | year = 1989 | title = Analysis of any point mutation in DNA. The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 17 |issue=7 | pages = 2503–2516 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.7.2503 | pmid=2785681 | pmc=317639}}</ref> In this process, a mutant PCR primer is used to select for the mutant over the wild-type genotype. If the mutant genotype is present, it anneals to the 3’ end of the PCR primer while the wild-type genotype results in mismatched DNA at the 3’ end. The mismatch between the 3’ end of the primer and wild-type prevents primer extension and thus, only the mutant genotype produces a PCR product. Hotstart [[Taq polymerase]] lacking 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity was used for colony PCR of the putative mutants.<ref name="":0"" /> 	

The SCAR-less method is able to induce point mutations, oligonucleotide-mediated deletions, and short sequence insertions with a high efficiency. In the case of point mutations, oligonucleotides targeted to the lagging strand are designed to alter the either the PAM sequence or the protospacer sequences within 12 base pairs of the PAM as this is the most important region for Cas9 specificity.<ref name="":0"" /> With this process, both [[Nonsense mutation|nonsense]] and [[missense mutation]]s are possible. However, the subsequent transformations differ between nonsense and missense mutations: double transformations, where the pCas9cr4 plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed simultaneously, are more efficient for nonsense mutations while single transformations, where each plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed independently, are better suited for missense mutations <ref name="":0"" /> as demonstrated by colony PCR. The method is also able to successfully delete large regions of chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotides designed with upstream and downstream homology to the area of deletion. In the case of deletions, a single transformation protocol is more efficient and shows a 100% deletion rate following colony PCR.<ref name="":0"" /> Further work should be pursued to determine causes for the different transformation efficiencies for various mutation types. 	

Short sequence insertions are also possible using the SCAR-less method. In order to circumvent oligonucleotide length constraints, linear [[DNA|dsDNA]] sequences are used to insert fragments into the chromosome. Because the system uses a plasmid that expresses the exo and gam genes from the λ-red system it is able to use oligonucleotide recombineering techniques for sequence insertion. More specifically, the dsDNA strands facilitate insertion through the mechanism of single-strand intermediates at the replication fork. Previous methods were successful in inserting 30bp into the chromosome <ref>{{Cite journal

===Limitations===
The current system is not able to simultaneously select against more than one target <ref name="":0"" /> as a result of difficulties in DNA synthesis and ligation independent cloning methods. Essentially this means that the highly repetitive sequences necessary for multiple sgRNA in a single plasmid are constrained by flaws in the biological machinery necessary to express them and target them to more than one target. Future improvements are necessary to allow simultaneous genomic manipulations using several distinct sgRNA in a single plasmid.

Challenges underlying plasmid recombination and loss of protospacer sequences also impact the no-SCAR method and require further improvements.<ref name="":0"" /> Poor plasmid recombination underlies frequency of escape difficulties that may impact the efficiency of genetic manipulation.

}}</ref> as well as other scar-free genome editing techniques. The method allows for unlimited numbers of single step genomic alterations without the use of selectable markers. The great advantage of the method, specifically in terms research applications, is the speed of the protocol. In the seminal paper by Reisch and Prather, the no-SCAR method required 5 days of work including the cloning step necessary for sgRNA targeting. Once the cells contain the pCas9cr4 plasmid, subsequent experiments can be completed in as little as 3 days allowing for rapid genome editing. Currently, the no-SCAR method is faster than any other method published <ref name="":0"" /> and is an attractive option for researchers interested in studying the effects of numerous modifications. 	

When compared specifically to other scar-free genome editing techniques including the method published by Datsenko and Wanner,<ref name="":1"" /> the no-SCAR method is less time-consuming when multiple mutations are desired. Two components of the method mediate this rapid mutation ability. First, the pCas9cr4 plasmid is retained in the cells after the first iteration thus preventing repetitive transfection of the plasmid into the cells. In instances where three genome modifications are desired, for example, this means that the no-SCAR method is able to mediate these mutations four days faster than the next fastest method.<ref name="":0"" /> Second, the wild-type gene is never removed from the chromosome. This means that PCR screening is able to more quickly identify numerous mutants because essential wild-type genes can be targeted with ease.

===Human health===

In terms of human health, it has applications to both specific diseases as well as [[stem cell]] systems that model these same diseases.

'''Pandemic prevention''' is the organization and management of preventive measures against [[pandemic]]s. Those include measures to reduce causes of new infectious diseases and measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics from becoming pandemics.

It is not to be mistaken for [[Pandemic#Pandemic preparedness|pandemic preparedness]] or mitigation (e.g. [[Treatment and management of COVID-19|against COVID-19]]) which largely seek to mitigate the magnitude of negative effects of pandemics, although the topics may overlap with pandemic prevention in some respects.

Some efforts of pandemic prevention reportedly risk triggering pandemics while not engaging in any form of pandemic prevention is risky as well.

=== 2002–2004 SARS outbreak ===
During the [[2002–2004 SARS outbreak]], the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV-1]] virus was prevented from causing a pandemic of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS). Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. Human-to-human transmission of SARS may be considered eradicated, however, it could re-emerge as SARS-CoV-1 probably persists as a potential zoonotic threat in its original animal reservoir.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morens DM, Fauci AS | title = Emerging Pandemic Diseases: How We Got to COVID-19 | journal = Cell | volume = 182 | issue = 5 | pages = 1077–1092 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32846157 | pmc = 7428724 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith R|date=December 2019|title=Did we Eradicate SARS?

However, they weren't able to test PAC-MAN on the actual [[SARS-CoV-2]], use a targeting-mechanism that uses only a very limited [[RNA]]-region, haven't developed a system to deliver it into human cells and would need [[Phases of clinical research|a lot of time]] until another version of it or a potential successor system might pass [[clinical trial]]s. In the study published as a [[preprint]] they write that it could be used prophylactically as well as therapeutically. The [[CRISPR-Cas13d]]-based system could be agnostic to which virus it's fighting so novel viruses would only require a small change.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Levy |first1=Steven |title=Could Crispr Be Humanity's Next Virus Killer? |url=https://www.wired.com/story/could-crispr-be-the-next-virus-killer/ |magazine=Wired |access-date=25 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abbott |first1=Timothy R. |last2=Dhamdhere |first2=Girija |last3=Liu |first3=Yanxia |last4=Lin |first4=Xueqiu |last5=Goudy |first5=Laine |last6=Zeng |first6=Leiping |last7=Chemparathy |first7=Augustine |last8=Chmura |first8=Stephen |last9=Heaton |first9=Nicholas S. |last10=Debs |first10=Robert |last11=Pande |first11=Tara |last12=Endy |first12=Drew |last13=Russa |first13=Marie La |last14=Lewis |first14=David B. |last15=Qi |first15=Lei S. |title=Development of CRISPR as a prophylactic strategy to combat novel coronavirus and influenza |journal=bioRxiv |date=14 March 2020 |pages=2020.03.13.991307 |doi=10.1101/2020.03.13.991307 |url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.991307v1 |access-date=25 March 2020 |language=en|doi-access=free }}</ref> In an editorial published in February 2020 another group of scientists claimed that they have implemented a flexible and efficient approach for targeting RNA with CRISPR-Cas13d which they have put under review and propose that the system can be used to also target SARS-CoV-2 in specific.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Tuan M. |last2=Zhang |first2=Yang |last3=Pandolfi |first3=Pier Paolo |title=Virus against virus: a potential treatment for 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) and other RNA viruses |journal=Cell Research |pages=189–190 |language=en |doi=10.1038/s41422-020-0290-0 |date=March 2020|volume=30 |issue=3 |pmid=32071427 |pmc=7054296 }}</ref> There have also been earlier successful efforts in fighting viruses with CRISPR-based technology in human cells.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Tanya |title=Scientists Program CRISPR to Fight Viruses in Human Cells |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-program-crispr-to-fight-viruses-in-human-cells/ |website=Scientific American |access-date=1 April 2020 |language=en |date=23 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Combatting Viruses with RNA-Targeted CRISPR |url=https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/combatting-viruses-with-rna-targeted-crispr-35580 |website=The Scientist Magazine® |access-date=1 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In March 2020 researchers reported that they have developed a new kind of CRISPR-Cas13d screening platform for effective [[guide RNA]] design to target [[RNA]].

Their technology could be used in molecular biology and in medical applications such as for better targeting of virus RNA or human RNA. Targeting human RNA after it's been transcribed from DNA, rather than DNA, would allow for more temporary effects than permanent changes to human genomes.

===== Mutation surveillance =====
[[File:Biology of SARS-CoV-2 – Evolution and Mutations.webm|thumb|Positive, negative, and neutral mutations of the evolution of coronaviruses like [[SARS-CoV-2]].]]
In December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, national and international officials reported [[variants of SARS-CoV-2|mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2]], including some with higher transmissibility and worldwide spread. While mutations are common for viruses and the spread of some of the virus' mutations have been tracked earlier, mutations that make it more transmittable or severe can be problematic. Resources for disease surveillance have improved during the pandemic so that medical systems around the world are starting to be equipped to detect such mutations with genomic surveillance in a manner relevant to pandemic mitigation and the prevention of sub-pandemics of specific variants or types of variants. As of December 2020, contemporary measures such as [[COVID-19 vaccine]]s and medications seem to be <!--sufficiently or largely -->effective in the treatment of infections with the tracked mutated variants compared to earlier forms that are closer to the original virus/es.<ref name=""cvvariant-nytimes"">{{cite news |last1=Zimmer |first1=Carl |last2=Carey |first2=Benedict |title=The U.K. Coronavirus Variant: What We Know |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/health/new-covid-strain-uk.html |access-date=16 January 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=21 December 2020}}</ref><ref name=""variants-who"">{{cite web |title=WHO {{!}} SARS-CoV-2 Variants |url=https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-december-2020-sars-cov2-variants/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201231181601/https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-december-2020-sars-cov2-variants/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 31, 2020 |website=WHO |access-date=16 January 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Update On Covid-19 (18th December 2020) - SA Corona Virus Online Portal |url=https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/12/18/update-on-covid-19-18th-december-2020/ |access-date=16 January 2021 |work=SA Corona Virus Online Portal |language=en-ZA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Carlson |first1=Andrea Michelson, Hilary Brueck, Nicholas |title=The unlikely prospect of a COVID-19 variant that outsmarts vaccines 'keeps me up at night,' CDC Director Rochelle Walensky says in The EIC Interview |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-head-covid-escape-variant-keeps-me-up-at-night-2021-8 |website=Business Insider |access-date=12 August 2021}}</ref>

The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the ""exponential rise"" in [[Overconsumption|consumption]] and trade of commodities such as meat, palm oil, and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a [[Population growth|growing human population]]. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, ""there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic.

According to a 2001 study and its criteria a total of 1415 species of infectious agents in 472 different genera have been reported to date to cause disease in humans. Out of these reviewed emerging pathogen species 75% are zoonotic. A total of 175 species of infectious agents from 96 different genera are associated with emerging diseases according its criteria. Some of these pathogens can be transmitted by more than one route.

'''Surveyor nuclease assay''' is an enzyme mismatch cleavage assay used to detect [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|single base mismatches]] or small insertions or deletions ([[indel]]s).

Surveyor nuclease is part of a family of mismatch-specific [[endonuclease]]s that were discovered in celery (CEL nucleases).<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|title = Purification, cloning, and characterization of the CEL I nuclease|journal = Biochemistry|date = 2000-04-04|issn = 0006-2960|pmid = 10736152|pages = 3533–3541|volume = 39|issue = 13|first1 = B.|last1 = Yang|first2 = X.|last2 = Wen|first3 = N.

This assay has been used to identify and analyze mutations in a variety of organisms and cell types, as well as to confirm genome modifications following genome editing (using [[CRISPR]]/[[TALENs]]/[[zinc finger]]s).

== Background ==
The ability to discover and detect known and unknown mutations is of great importance in biomedical research and genetic diagnosis (see Applications). Therefore, multiple methods have been developed to enable research-based and clinical diagnostic detection of such mutations.

The most direct manner to identify the sequence changes/differences is through reading the DNA sequence with traditional and high throughput DNA sequencing methods (see [[Sanger sequencing]] and [[DNA sequencing]]). However, these methods provide large amounts of unnecessary data and are costly to use.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|title = Enzymatic mutation detection technologies|journal = BioTechniques|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 0736-6205|pmid = 15948293|pages = 749–758|volume = 38|issue = 5|first1 = Anthony T.|last1 = Yeung|first2 = Deepali|last2 = Hattangadi|first3 = Lauryn|last3 = Blakesley|first4 = Emmanuelle|last4 = Nicolas|doi=10.2144/05385rv01|doi-access = free}}</ref> In addition, traditional sequencing can be useful for detection of germline mutations, but may be less successful in detecting somatic minor alleles at low frequencies ([[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]]). Therefore, other non-sequencing based approaches to detect the mutation or polymorphisms are required.

Other widely used methods depend on physical properties of DNA, for example melting temperature-based systems such as [[Single-strand conformation polymorphism|Single-stranded conformational polymorphism]] analysis (SSCP) and [[Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography|Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography]] (DHPLC). These techniques are generally limited to the analysis of short DNA fragments (< 1000 bp) and are only able to indicate the presence of polymorphism(s), but do not easily yield the location of a mutation within a DNA sequence. Therefore, this must be followed with additional techniques in order to pinpoint the mutation or map multiple mutations in the same fragment.<ref name="":1"" />

Enzymatic mismatch cleavage assays exploit the properties of mismatch-specific endonucleases to detect and cleave mismatches. These methods are simple to run using standard laboratory techniques and equipment, and can detect polymorphisms, single base pair mismatches, and insertions and deletions at low frequencies.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A simple, high sensitivity mutation screening using Ampligase mediated T7 endonuclease I and Surveyor nuclease with microfluidic capillary electrophoresis|journal = Electrophoresis|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1522-2683|pmid = 22437793|pages = 788–796|volume = 33|issue = 5|doi = 10.1002/elps.201100460|first1 = Mo Chao|last1 = Huang|first2 = Wai Chye|last2 = Cheong|first3 = Li Shi|last3 = Lim|first4 = Mo-Huang|last4 = Li|s2cid = 40764751}}</ref> Several such enzymes have been discovered (including CEL I, T4 endonuclease VII, Endonuclease V, T7 endonuclease I).<ref name="":1"" />

One of the commonly used enzymes is Surveyor nuclease (CEL II), which cleaves the 3′ side of both DNA strands with high specificity at sites of base substitution or insertion/deletion. This enzyme is capable of cleaving at multiple mutations in large DNA fragments, and produces detectable cleavage products from mismatch DNA representing only a small proportion of the DNA in a population, thus making it suitable for use in enzyme mismatch cleavage assays.<ref name="":0"" />

== History ==
In 1998, Olekowski et al.<ref name="":5"" /> identified a new mismatch specific endonuclease. The enzyme was purified from celery and was given the name CEL I.

CEL I was shown to cut DNA with high specificity on both strands at the 3′ side of base-substitution mismatches, and can therefore be used in enzyme mutation detection methods to identify mutations and polymorphisms. Olekowski and colleagues demonstrated this technique by using this enzyme to detect a variety of mutations and polymorphisms in the human BRCA1 gene.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":5"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = CEL I enzymatic mutation detection assay|journal = BioTechniques|date = 2000-07-01|issn = 0736-6205|pmid = 10907074|pages = 44–46, 48|volume = 29|issue = 1|first1 = J.|last1 = Kulinski|first2 = D.|last2 = Besack|first3 = C. A.|last3 = Oleykowski|first4 = A. K.|last4 = Godwin|first5 = A. T.|last5 = Yeung|doi = 10.2144/00291bm07|doi-access = free}}</ref>

While monitoring the purification of CEL I using [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], Yang et al.<ref name="":2"" /> noticed that there were two nuclease bands that stayed together during all the purification steps. The major nuclease activity was designated CEL I, while the minor activity on SDS-PAGE was named CEL II. They concluded that CEL I and CEL II are similar, and that both are able to cleave a DNA mismatch.

In 2004, Qiu et al. developed a mutation detection technology based on CEL II, also known as Surveyor Nuclease.<ref name="":0"" /> Since then the method has been used to detect mutations and polymorphisms in many different organisms and cell types (see applications).

Surveyor nuclease was licensed from the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]] by [[Transgenomic, Inc.]] and was subsequently sold to [[Integrated DNA Technologies|IDT]], which currently distributes it.

== Surveyor nuclease assay workflow ==

=== DNA Extraction ===
Initially, the DNA of interest (nuclear or [[mitochondrial DNA]]) is extracted from tissues or cell culture. This can be done by standard extraction methods such as Proteinase K digestion followed by ethanol precipitation or by other commercially available methods.

If the DNA is predicted to be heterogeneous, e.g. from a pool of differentially modified cells or from heterozygous mutation carriers, there is no need to add control DNA.

=== Polymerase chain reaction ===
The region of interest in both mutant and wild-type reference DNA is amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). The PCR reaction should be carried out using a high-fidelity proofreading polymerase to avoid introducing PCR errors that will be interpreted by the nuclease. The PCR reaction should be optimized to create a single, strong PCR band, as non-specific bands will increase the [[Noise (signal processing)|background noise]] of the assay.

If the allele of interest is expected to be present in low frequency, such as in the case of somatic [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] or heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA, a modified PCR protocol that enriches variant alleles from a mixture of wild-type and mutation-containing DNA might be considered (e.g. [[COLD-PCR]]).

=== Formation of hybrid DNA duplex ===
The DNA of interest is denatured and annealed in order to form heteroduplexes containing a mismatch at the point of the mutation, which can then be identified by the Surveyor nuclease. If the DNA is predicted to be homogenous (e.g. homoplasmic mitochondrial DNA or identical alleles on both chromosomes of genomic DNA) then DNA from a control sample is needed in order to form a heteroduplex which is then recognizable by the nuclease. If the DNA sample is heterogeneous, no additional control DNA is needed; however, the PCR products should still be denatured and annealed in order to create heteroduplexes.

=== Digestion ===
The annealed DNA is treated with Surveyor nuclease to cleave the heteroduplexes.  All types of mismatches are identifiable by Surveyor nuclease, although the mismatch cutting preferences fall into four groups from most to least preferred: CT, AC, and CC are preferred equally over TT, followed by AA and GG, and finally followed by the least preferred, AG and GT. Sequence context also influences the Surveyor nuclease digestion rate.<ref name="":0"" />

=== Analysis ===
Digested DNA products can be analyzed using conventional gel electrophoresis or high-resolution capillary electrophoresis. The detection of cleaved products indicates the presence of a heteroduplex formed by a mismatch. The location of the mutation/polymorphism can be inferred by observing the fragment length after cleavage. If fluorescent labelled primers are used to mark the 5’ and 3’ end of the PCR products, different colored bands will be observed in the analysis. The size of each band independently confirms the position of the mutation/polymorphism. Multiple mutations can be detected by the presence of several fragments.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal|pmc = 147896|title = Mutation detection using a novel plant endonuclease|last1 = Oleykowski|first1 = Catherine A.|date = 1998|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|doi = 10.1093/nar/26.20.4597|pmid = 9753726|last2 = Mullins|first2 = Colleen RB|issue = 20|pages = 4597–4602|last3 = Godwin|first3 = Andrew K|last4 = Yeung|first4 = Anthony T|volume=26}}</ref>

== Advantages and limitations ==

=== Advantages ===

====Advantages of mismatch nuclease assays====
One of the main advantages of detecting mutations and polymorphisms using mismatch nuclease methods is that no previous knowledge is required regarding the nature of the mutation, as opposed to other methods, such as [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]]s (RFLP) that has been used for SNP analysis in the past.

In comparison to methods based on melting temperature, mismatch-specific endonuclease methods are not only faster, but can also detect multiple mutations in large DNA fragments.

The method is feasible to use in high-throughput systems using automated injection, making it suitable for screening.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite journal|title = Comparison of the mismatch-specific endonuclease method and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography for the identification of HBB gene mutations|journal = BMC Biotechnology|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 1472-6750|pmc = 2525636|pmid = 18694524|pages = 62|volume = 8|doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-8-62|first1 = Chia-Cheng|last1 = Hung|first2 = Yi-Ning|last2 = Su|first3 = Chia-Yun|last3 = Lin|first4 = Yin-Fei|last4 = Chang|first5 = Chien-Hui|last5 = Chang|first6 = Wen-Fang|last6 = Cheng|first7 = Chi-An|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chien-Nan|last8 = Lee|first9 = Win-Li|last9 = Lin}}</ref>

====Advantages of surveyor nuclease====
Surveyor nuclease is a reasonably sensitive enzyme, producing detectable cleavage products from sequences representing only a small proportion of DNA in the population. It can detect a ratio of 1:32 heteroduplex to homoduplex for smaller PCR products (~0.6 kb), and 1:16 heteroduplex to homoduplex for longer PCR products (~2.3 kb). This property makes it possible to [[Group testing|pool]] clinical samples in order to increase the heteroduplex formation and hence the sensitivity.<ref name="":1"" /> This is also useful for detection of minor variants in a heterogeneous population (such as heterogeneous tumor). In the case of genome editing by CRISPR or other methods, this property can enhance detection of rare editing events in a population of cells prior to creation and testing of individual edited clones.

Surveyor nuclease cleaves all types of mismatches, even if some are more preferred then others: CT, AC, and CC are preferred equally over TT, followed by AA and GG, and finally followed by the least preferred, AG and GT. It also detects [[Indel]]s up to at least 12 bp.<ref name="":0"" />

Surveyor nuclease assay can also detect multiple mutations in the same fragment. However, this requires several additional processing steps that may also increase the background of the assay (see Limitations).

=== Limitations ===

====PCR amplification product====
One of the main limitations of this assay is that it relies on PCR amplification, and is therefore influenced by the quality of the amplified product. PCR artifacts (e.g. primer-dimers or truncated products) can increase the background noise and obscure the signal. Primer-dimers can also inhibit the activity of surveyor nuclease, reducing the signal.

As the PCR method has the potential to introduce its own mutations during the amplification, these errors can also increase background noise. Therefore, it is best to use a high-fidelity polymerase to minimize the amplification errors.

Mitochondrial DNA analysis might be susceptible to contamination by nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences co-amplified during the PCR reaction, thus confounding the analysis of homoplasmic versus heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Interference of Co-amplified nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences on the determination of human mtDNA heteroplasmy by Using the SURVEYOR nuclease and the WAVE HS system|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3963942|pmid = 24664244|pages = e92817|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0092817|first1 = Hsiu-Chuan|last1 = Yen|first2 = Shiue-Li|last2 = Li|first3 = Wei-Chien|last3 = Hsu|first4 = Petrus|last4 = Tang|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...992817Y|doi-access = free}}</ref>

In order to detect multiple mutations in the same fragment, post-PCR clean-up must be done before Surveyor nuclease digestion. Detection of multiple mismatches can also be improved by increasing time and amount of surveyor nuclease in the reaction, but this also increases the background due to non-specific cleavage.

====Limitations of the surveyor nuclease enzyme====

Surveyor nuclease also has a 5′ exonuclease activity that attacks the ends of double‐stranded DNA increasing background signal during extended incubation.<ref name="":0"" /> This can be reduced by shortening the digestion time and by adding DNA polymerase.

== Applications ==

=== Confirming genome modifications using CRISPR and other methods ===
A number of genome editing technologies have emerged in recent years, including [[Zinc finger nuclease|zinc-finger nucleases]] (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases ([[TALENs]]) and the RNA-guided [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] nuclease system. These methods promote genome editing by introduction of a double strand DNA break, followed by repair through the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. While HDR is expected to introduce a consistent modification to the genome, NHEJ can introduce a heterogeneous mix of mutations (usually small indels), which will be difficult to identify using Sanger sequencing. Point mutations and indels can be detected by surveyor nuclease assay, making it useful to detect genome editing in a pool of cells without the need for clonal expansion prior to analysis, and it can also provide an estimate of the targeting efficiency achieved.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A rapid and general assay for monitoring endogenous gene modification|journal = [[Methods in Molecular Biology]]|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1940-6029|pmid = 20680839|pages = 247–256|volume = 649|doi = 10.1007/978-1-60761-753-2_15|first1 = Dmitry Y.|last1 = Guschin|first2 = Adam J.|last2 = Waite|first3 = George E.|last3 = Katibah|first4 = Jeffrey C.|last4 = Miller|first5 = Michael C.|last5 = Holmes|first6 = Edward J.|last6 = Rebar|isbn = 978-1-60761-752-5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Double nicking by RNA-guided CRISPR Cas9 for enhanced genome editing specificity|journal = Cell|date = 2013-09-12|issn = 1097-4172|pmc = 3856256|pmid = 23992846|pages = 1380–1389|volume = 154|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.021|first1 = F.

==Evolutionary history==
[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic [[prokaryotes]] that have existed on [[Earth]] for an estimated 2.7 billion years.

==Growth and use as a model organism==
[[Cyanobacteria]] are [[model organism|model microorganisms]] for the study of [[photosynthesis]], [[carbon assimilation|carbon]] and [[nitrogen assimilation]], evolution of plant [[plastids]], and adaptability to [[environmental stress]]es.
''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 is one of the most highly studied types of [[cyanobacteria]] as it can grow both autotrophically or heterotrophically in the absence of light. It was isolated from a [[freshwater]] [[lake]] in 1968 and grows best between 32 and 38 degrees [[Celsius]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Červený J, Sinetova MA, Zavřel T, Los DA | title = Mechanisms of High Temperature Resistance of Synechocystis sp.

The organism also exhibits [[Phototaxis|phototactic movement]].

''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 can be grown on either [[agar plates]] or in [[liquid culture]]. The most widely used culture medium is a BG-11 salt solution.<ref name=williams1988 /> The ideal [[pH]] is between 7 and 8.5.<ref name=heidorn/> A light intensity of 50 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> leads to best growth.<ref name=heidorn/> Bubbling with [[carbon dioxide]] enriched air (1–2% CO<sub>2</sub>) can increase the growth rate, but may require additional [[buffer solution|buffer]] to maintain [[pH]]<ref name=heidorn/>

PCC6803 the ideal concentrations of [[kanamycin]], [[spectinomycin]], [[streptomycin]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[erythromycin]], and [[gentamicin]].<ref name=heidorn/> Cultures can be kept on [[agar plates]] for approximately 2 weeks and re-streaked indefinitely.<ref name=williams1988 /> For long term storage, liquid cell cultures should be stored in a 15% [[glycerol]] solution at -80 degrees [[Celsius]].<ref name=williams1988>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Williams JG |title=Construction of specific mutations in photosystem II photosynthetic reaction center by genetic engineering methods in Synechocystis 6803|journal=Methods in Enzymology|date=1988|volume=167|pages=766–778|doi=10.1016/0076-6879(88)67088-1|isbn=9780121820688}}</ref>

==Genome==
The [[genome]] of ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 is contained within approximately 12 copies of a single [[chromosome]] (3.57 megabases), three small [[plasmids]]: pCC5.2 (5.2 kb) pCA2.4 (2.4 kb), and pCB2.4 (2.4 kb) and four large plasmids: pSYSM (120 kb), pSYSX (106 kb), pSYSA (103kb), and pSYSG (44 kb).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Labarre J, Chauvat F, Thuriaux P | title = Insertional mutagenesis by random cloning of antibiotic resistance genes into the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 171 | issue = 6 | pages = 3449–57 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2498291 | pmc = 210070 | doi = 10.1128/jb.171.6.3449-3457.1989 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaneko T, Nakamura Y, Sasamoto S, Watanabe A, Kohara M, Matsumoto M, Shimpo S, Yamada M, Tabata S | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural analysis of four large plasmids harboring in a unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp.

==Additional strains==
The primary strain of ''Synechocystis'' sp. is PCC6803. Further modifications of the parent PCC6803 strain have been created, such as a sub-strain lacking [[photosystem 1]] (PSI).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shen G, Boussiba S, Vermaas WF | title = Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 strains lacking photosystem I and phycobilisome function | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1853–63 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8305875 | pmc = 160410 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.5.12.1853 }}</ref> The other widely used sub-strain of ''Synechocystis'' sp. is a [[glucose]] tolerant strain, ATCC 27184.

==Light-activated heterotrophy==
''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803, sub-strain ATCC 27184 can live [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophically]] in the dark on the carbon source [[glucose]], but for yet unknown reasons requires a minimum of 5 to 15 minutes (blue) light per day. This regulatory role of light is intact in both [[photosystem 1|PSI]] and [[photosystem 2|PSII]] deficient strains.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson SL, McIntosh L | title = Light-activated heterotrophic growth of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803: a blue-light-requiring process | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 173 | issue = 9 | pages = 2761–7 | date = May 1991 | pmid = 1902208 | pmc = 207855 | doi = 10.1128/jb.173.9.2761-2767.1991 }}</ref>

Some [[glycolysis|glycolytic]] genes are regulated by the gene''sll1330'' under light and glucose-supplemented conditions. One of the most important glycolytic genes is [[Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase|fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase]] (''fbaA''). The mRNA level of ''fbaA'' is increased under light and glucose-supplemented conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabei Y, Okada K, Tsuzuki M | title = Sll1330 controls the expression of glycolytic genes in Synechocystis sp.

==Native CRISPR-Cas system==
The [[CRISPR]]-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats – CRISPR associated proteins) system provides [[adaptive immunity]] in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 contains three different CRISPR-Cas systems: type I-D, and two versions of type III. All three CRISPR-Cas systems are localize on the pSYSA plasmid. All [[cyanobacteria]] are lacking the type II system, which has been widely adapted for genetic engineering purposes across many species.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scholz I, Lange SJ, Hein S, Hess WR, Backofen R | title = CRISPR-Cas systems in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 exhibit distinct processing pathways involving at least two Cas6 and a Cmr2 protein | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e56470 | date = 18 February 2013 | pmid = 23441196 | pmc = 3575380 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0056470 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...856470S | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==RNA polymerase and sigma factors==

[[RNA polymerase]] (RNAP) and [[sigma factor]]s are necessary proteins for [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of DNA into [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Eubacterial RNAP [[holoenzymes]] consist of a core with four major subunits α2 ββ'. In cyanobacteria, β' is formed from two smaller subunits (у and β'), which corresponds to RNAPs in plant [[chloroplasts]].<ref name=imamura>{{cite journal | vauthors = Imamura S, Asayama M | title = Sigma factors for cyanobacterial transcription | journal = Gene Regulation and Systems Biology | volume = 3 | pages = 65–87 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19838335 | pmc = 2758279 | doi = 10.4137/grsb.s2090 }}</ref>  The [[DNA clamp|beta subunits]] are responsible for binding the RNAP to the DNA, preventing premature dissociation. In ''Escherichia coli'', the beta ""clamp"" first binds loosely and tightens as the RNAP approaches the [[start codon|start codon (AUG)]]. In cyanobacteria, the beta clamp binds tightly at initial binding. The effect of this difference is that synthetic repressible promoters do not function as expected in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803. In ''E. coli'', a repressor binds the DNA operon and dislodges RNAP due to the loosely bound beta clamp, whereas in ''Synechocystis'', the RNAP is tightly bound leading the reverse phenomenon where the repressor is knocked off the DNA. Thus the gene is not effectively repressed.<ref name=camsundlac>{{cite journal | vauthors = Camsund D, Heidorn T, Lindblad P | title = Design and analysis of LacI-repressed promoters and DNA-looping in a cyanobacterium | journal = Journal of Biological Engineering | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24467947 | pmc = 3922697 | doi = 10.1186/1754-1611-8-4 }}</ref>
''Synechocystis'' possesses the 70S [[sigma factor]] (σ70), which can be divided into three groups. Group 1 [[sigma factor]]s are critical for cell viability. Group 2, similar in structure to Group 1, is not essential for cell vitality. Group 3 is structurally different and involved with survival under stress conditions. ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 lacks the σN factor found in other organisms, such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', which is involved with transcribing genes related to nitrogen, but is nonetheless able to metabolize nitrogen.<ref name=imamura />

==Natural genetic transformation==

''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 is capable of [[transformation (genetics)|natural genetic transformation]].<ref>Grigorieva G, Shestakov S. Transformation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 6803 FEMS Microbiology Letters 13 (1982) 367-370 Published by Elsevier Biomedical Press https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1574-6968.1982.tb08289.x</ref>  For [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] to take place, the recipient bacteria must be in a [[natural competence|competent state]].  A gene, ''comF'', was shown to be involved in competence development in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803.<ref name=""pmid17159215"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakasugi K, Svenson CJ, Neilan BA | title = The competence gene, comF, from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is involved in natural transformation, phototactic motility and piliation | journal = Microbiology | volume = 152 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3623–3631 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17159215 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.29189-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Synthetic biology/genetic engineering==
''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 is considered a [[model organism]], yet there exist few synthetic parts that can be used for [[genetic engineering]]. As cyanobacteria in general have slow [[doubling time]]s (4.5 to 5 h in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6301 <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakamoto T, Bryant DA | title = Nitrate transport and not photoinhibition limits growth of the freshwater Cyanobacterium synechococcus species PCC 6301 at low temperature | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 785–94 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 9952475 | pmc = 32156 | doi = 10.1104/pp.119.2.785 | url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/119/2/785 }}</ref>), it is more efficient to perform as much DNA cloning as possible in a fast growing host, such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. In order to create [[plasmids]]—stable, replicating circular pieces of DNA—that will function successfully in multiple species, a broad-host-range shuttle vector (see Replicative Plasmids below) is needed. Gene promoters, which control gene expression, need to also predictably work in multiple hosts (see Promoters below).

===Replicative plasmids===
Currently there is only one [[shuttle vector|broad-host-range shuttle vector]], RSF1010, that successfully replicates in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803.<ref name=heidorn /> RSF1010 is a mobilization plasmid that facilitates [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] between cells, allowing the [[horizontal gene transfer]] of DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scholz P, Haring V, Wittmann-Liebold B, Ashman K, Bagdasarian M, Scherzinger E | title = Complete nucleotide sequence and gene organization of the broad-host-range plasmid RSF1010 | journal = Gene | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–88 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2653965 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(89)90273-4 }}</ref>  Additionally, RSF1010 encodes its own replication machinery, so that it does not depend on its host to possess the necessary proteins and assorted factors.<ref name=heidorn />

===Promoters===
[[Promoter (genetics)|Gene promoters]] are responsible for recruiting [[RNA polymerase|RNAP]] and facilitating [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of DNA. Type I promoters consists of a consensus -35 and -10 region ([[Pribnow box]])<ref name=imamura /> upstream of the gene start site. Heidorn et al. 2011 compiled a list of native ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 promoters that have been used in [[Synthetic biology|synthetic constructs]], although this leads to [[Crosstalk (biology)|cross talk]] and non-orthogonal or non-specific gene expression.<ref name=heidorn /> A handful of Anderson promoters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson|title=Promoters/Catalog/Anderson|website=Registry of Standard Biological Parts}}</ref> (a group of constitutive promoters collected from a combinatorial library based on the consensus -35 ('''5'-TTGACA-3{{'}}''') and -10 ('''5’-TATAAT-3’''') regions), represented best by BBa_J23101, have been demonstrated to function in ''Synechocystis'' sp.

For [[synthetic biology]], it is critical to have inducible promoters, or genes that can be turned on/off on demand. Several popular inducible promoters in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' are the [[PBAD promoter|pBad]], [[Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation|pTet]], and [[lac operon|pLac]] promoters, all of which repress gene expression by a [[repressor|repressor molecule]] that binds the gene [[Operator (biology)|operator]] and blocks RNAP progression.

Progress in engineering ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 is currently hampered by promoter issues. As noted above in RNA Polymerase and Sigma Factors, the beta clamp proteins within the RNAP complex have a higher initial [[binding affinity]] in ''Synechocystis'' sp. versus other eubacterial models.<ref name=camsundlac /> Thus promoters that turn on/off in response to small binding molecules are less effective in ''Synechocystis'' since the RNAP can knock them off the DNA strand.<ref name=camsundlac /> Camsund, Heidorn and Lindblad 2014 attempted to enhance [[lac operon|pLac]] repression in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 by engineering a promoter with multiple operons, thus facilitating DNA looping.<ref name=camsundlac /> Their attempt was too effective, as it was now too difficult to induce transcription in highly repressed variants.<ref name=camsundlac /> Huang and Lindblad 2013 created a library of modified [[Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation|pTet]] promoters with varying levels of repression and dynamic range in the [[glucose]] tolerant ''Synechocystis'' sp. ATCC 27184.<ref name=huanglindblad /> 
Another option are promoters that are inducible by heavy metals, such as: [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[arsenic]], [[nickel]] and [[chromium]].<ref name=peca>{{cite journal| vauthors = Peca L |title=Characterization of the activity of heavy metal-responsive promoters in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803|journal=Acta Biologica Hungarica|date=2007|volume=58|pages=11–22|doi=10.1556/ABiol.58.2007.Suppl.2|pmid=18297791}}</ref> Several such promoters were evaluated in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 by Peca 2007. These promoters are not ideal, as [[metal ions]] are critical in ''Synechocystis''’ metabolic pathways and altering concentrations can lead to compounding undesired side effects.<ref name=peca /> Additionally, working with these promoters produces waste contaminated with [[heavy metals]], increasing disposal costs

===Ribosome binding site (RBS)===
The [[Ribosomal binding site|ribosome binding site (RBS)]] is the location where a [[ribosome]] binds a strand of [[mRNA]] and begins [[translation]]. In [[prokaryotes]], the RBS includes a [[Shine-Dalgarno]] sequence.<ref name=heidorn /> Little is known about the translation efficiency of RBSs in ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803.<ref name=heidorn /> Heidorn et al. 2011 scanned the ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC6803 genome and created a consensus RBS sequence ('''TAGTGGAGGT'''), which had 5 times higher output than the consensus ''E. coli'' sequence.<ref name=heidorn />

==Biofuel production==
[[Cyanobacteria]] have been used in several ways to produce renewable biofuel. The original method was to grow cyanobacteria for the [[biomass]], which could be converted through [[liquefaction]] into liquid fuel.

*[http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis/ CyanoBase]: Cyanobacteria carry a complete set of genes for oxygenic photosynthesis, which is the most fundamental life process on Earth. This organism is also interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint, for it arose in a very ancient age and has survived in various environments. The algal and land plant chloroplast evolved from cyanobacterial ancestors which developed an [[endosymbiotic]] relationship with a [[eukaryotic]] host cell. CyanoBase provides an easy way of accessing the sequences and all-inclusive annotation data on the structures of the cyanobacterial genomes. This database was originally developed by Makoto Hirosawa, Takakazu Kaneko and Satoshi Tabata, and the current version of CyanoBase has been developed and maintained by Yasukazu Nakamura, Takakazu Kaneko, and Satoshi Tabata at Kazusa DNA Research Institute.
*[http://string.embl.de/ STRING]: STRING is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they are derived from four sources: Genomic Context, High-throughput Experiments, (Conserved) Coexpression, and Previous Knowledge. The database currently contains 1,513,782 proteins in 373 species. Especially, the database provides interactions for ''Synechocystis'' sp. PCC 6803.
*[http://bioinformatics.zj.cn/cTFbase/index.php cTFbase]: cTFbase contains 1288 putative [[transcription factors]] (TFs) identified from 21 fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Through its user-friendly interactive interface, users can employ various criteria to retrieve all TF sequences and their detailed annotation information, including sequence features, domain architecture and sequence similarity against the linked databases. Furthermore, cTFbase also provides [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic trees]] of individual TF family, multiple sequence alignments of the DNA-binding domain and [[Homology (biology)|ortholog]] identification from any selected [[genomes]].

It strives to provide a comprehensive curated resource for all major [[model organism]] [[species]] while attempting to remove redundancy to create a single mapping of data. Users of The '''BioGRID''' can search for their [[protein]], [[chemical]] or [[publication]] of interest and retrieve annotation, as well as curated data as reported, by the primary literature and compiled by in house large-scale curation efforts. The BioGRID is hosted in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States and is partnered with the [[Saccharomyces Genome Database]], [[FlyBase]], [[WormBase]], [[PomBase]], and the Alliance of Genome Resources. The BioGRID is funded by the [[NIH]] and [[CIHR]]. BioGRID is an observer member of the [http://imex.sourceforge.net/ International Molecular Exchange Consortium] (IMEx).

==History==
The '''BioGRID''' was originally published and released as simply the [[General Repository for Interaction Datasets]]<ref name=""pmid12620108"" /> but was later renamed to the BioGRID<ref name=""pmid16381927"" /> in order to more concisely describe the project, and help distinguish it from several [[grid computing|GRID Computing]] projects with a similar name. Originally separated into [[organism]] specific databases, the newest version now provides a unified front end allowing for searches across several organisms simultaneously. The BioGRID was developed initially as a project at the [[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] but has since expanded to include teams at the Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancérologie at the [[Université de Montréal]] and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at [[Princeton University]].

==Curation of Genetic, Protein, and Chemical Interactions==
The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is an open access database that houses genetic and protein interactions curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major [[model organism]] species and humans. {{As of|2020|10|18}},<ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last1=Oughtred|first1=Rose|last2=Rust|first2=Jennifer|last3=Chang|first3=Christie|last4=Breitkreutz|first4=Bobby-Joe|last5=Stark|first5=Chris|last6=Willems|first6=Andrew|last7=Boucher|first7=Lorrie|last8=Leung|first8=Genie|last9=Kolas|first9=Nadine|last10=Zhang|first10=Frederick|last11=Dolma|first11=Sonam|date=2020-10-18|title=The BioGRID database: A comprehensive biomedical resource of curated protein, genetic, and chemical interactions|journal=Protein Science |volume=30|issue=1|pages=187–200|doi=10.1002/pro.3978|issn=1469-896X|pmc=7737760|pmid=33070389}}</ref> the BioGRID contains 1,928 million interactions as drawn from 63,083 publications that represent 71 model organisms. At the start of 2021 it already contained more than 2,0 million biological interactions, 29,023 chemical-protein interactions, and 506,485 [[post-translational modification]]s collectively curated from 75,988 publications for more than 80 species.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Build Statistics (4.2.193) - January 2021 {{!}} BioGRID|url=https://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/build_4.2.193|access-date=2021-01-26|website=wiki.thebiogrid.org}}</ref> BioGRID data are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases and are directly downloadable in a variety of formats. BioGRID curation is coordinated through an Interaction Management System (IMS) that facilitates the compilation interaction records through structured evidence codes, phenotype ontologies, and gene annotation. The BioGRID architecture has been improved in order to support a broader range of interaction and post-translational modification types, to allow the representation of more complex multi-gene/protein interactions, to account for cellular phenotypes through structured ontologies, to expedite curation through semi-automated [[text mining]] approaches, and to enhance curation quality control. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for budding yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), thale cress (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''), and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'').

== Themed Curation Projects ==
Due to the overwhelming size of published scientific literature containing human ([[Human|''Homo sapiens'']]) [[gene]], [[protein]], and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] interactions, BioGRID has taken a targeted, project-based approach to curation of human interaction data in manageable collections of high impact data. These themed curation projects represent central biological processes with disease relevance such as [[Chromatin remodeling|chromatin modification]], [[autophagy]], and the [[ubiquitin]]-[[proteasome]] system or diseases of interest including [[glioblastoma]], [[Fanconi anemia|Fanconi Anemia]], and [[COVID-19]]. {{As of|2020|10|18}},<ref name="":1"" /> BioGRID themed curation project efforts have resulted in the extraction of 424,631 interactions involving 2,361 proteins from more than 37,000 scientific articles.

== Curation of Genome-Wide CRISPR Screens ==
[[CRISPR]]‐based genetic screens have now been reported in numerous publications that link [[gene]] function to [[Cell (biology)|cell]] viability, chemical and [[Abiotic stress|stress resistance]], and other [[phenotype]]s. To increase the accessibility of CRISPR screen data and facilitate assignment of [[Protein|protein function]], BioGRID has developed an embedded resource called the Open Repository of CRISPR Screens (ORCS)<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> to house and distribute manually curated, comprehensive collections of CRISPR screen datasets using [[Cas9]] and other [[Nuclease|CRISPR nucleases]]. {{As of|2020|10|18}},<ref name="":1"" /> BioGRID-ORCS contains more than 1,042 CRISPR screens curated from 114 publications representing more than 60,000 unique genes across three species human (''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''), fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), and house mouse (''[[House mouse|Mus musculus]]'') in over 670 [[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]] and 17 [[phenotype]]s.

==History==
===Early observations ===
Observations of what is now referred to as selfish genetic elements go back to the early days in the [[history of genetics]]. Already in 1928, Russian geneticist [[Sergey Gershenson]] reported the discovery of a driving [[X chromosome]] in ''Drosophila obscura''.<ref name="":5"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gershenson S | title = A New Sex-Ratio Abnormality in DROSOPHILA OBSCURA | journal = Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 488–507 | date = November 1928 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/13.6.488 | pmid = 17246563 | pmc = 1200995 }}</ref> Crucially, he noted that the resulting female-biased sex ratio may drive a population extinct (see [[#Species extinction|Species extinction]]). The earliest clear statement of how chromosomes may spread in a population not because of their positive fitness effects on the individual organism, but because of their own ""parasitic"" nature came from the Swedish botanist and cytogeneticist [[Gunnar Östergren]] in 1945.<ref name="":6"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Östergren G | title = Parasitic nature of extra fragment chromosomes. | journal = Botaniska Notiser | date = 1945 | volume = 2 | pages = 157–163 }}</ref> Discussing [[B chromosome]]s in plants he wrote:<ref name="":6"" />

<blockquote>In many cases these chromosomes have no useful function at all to the species carrying them, but that they often lead an exclusively parasitic existence ... [B chromosomes] need not be useful for the plants. They need only be useful to themselves.</blockquote>

Around the same time, several other examples of selfish genetic elements were reported. For example, the American maize geneticist [[Marcus Morton Rhoades|Marcus Rhoades]] described how chromosomal knobs led to female [[meiotic drive]] in maize.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rhoades MM | title = Preferential Segregation in Maize | journal = Genetics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–407 | date = July 1942 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/27.4.395 | pmid = 17247049 | pmc = 1209167 }}</ref> Similarly, this was also when it was first suggested that an [[intragenomic conflict]] between [[uniparental inheritance|uniparentally inherited]] mitochondrial genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes could lead to [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] in plants.<ref name="":7"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis D | title = Male sterility in natural populations of hermaphrodite plants the equilibrium between females and hermaphrodites to be expected with different types of inheritance. | journal = New Phytologist | date = April 1941 | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–63 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.1941.tb07028.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Then, in the early 1950s, [[Barbara McClintock]] published a series of papers describing the existence of [[transposable element]]s, which are now recognized to be among the most successful selfish genetic elements.<ref name="":8"">{{cite journal | vauthors = McClintock B | title = The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 344–55 | date = June 1950 | pmid = 15430309 | pmc = 1063197 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.36.6.344 | bibcode = 1950PNAS...36..344M | doi-access = free }}</ref> The discovery of transposable elements led to her being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1983]].

=== Conceptual developments ===
The empirical study of selfish genetic elements benefited greatly from the emergence of the so-called gene-centred view of evolution in the nineteen sixties and seventies.<ref name="":25"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ågren JA | title = Selfish genetic elements and the gene's-eye view of evolution | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 659–665 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 29491953 | pmc = 5804262 | doi = 10.1093/cz/zow102  }}</ref> In contrast with Darwin's original formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection that focused on individual organisms, the gene's-eye view takes the gene to be the central unit of selection in evolution.<ref>{{citation |title=Selfish Genes |last1= Ågren |first1=Jon Arvid |last2=Hurst |first2=Greg | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017-10-25 |website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets |doi=10.1093/obo/9780199941728-0094 }}</ref> It conceives evolution by natural selection as a process involving two separate entities: replicators (entities that produce faithful copies of themselves, usually genes) and vehicles (or interactors; entities that interact with the ecological environment, usually organisms).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The extended phenotype : the long reach of the gene|last=Dawkins |first=Richard | name-list-style = vanc |author-link=Richard Dawkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|oclc=610269469}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Dawkins R | chapter = Replicators and vehicles | editor = King's College Sociobiology Group, Cambridge | title =  Current Problems in Sociobiology. | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = June 1982 | pages = 45–64 | isbn = 978-0-521-28520-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Hull DL | chapter = Units of Evolution: A Metaphysical Essay | veditors = Jensen UJ, Harré R | title = The Philosophy of Evolution | publisher = St. Martin's Press | date = 1981 | pages = 23–44 }}</ref>

Since organisms are temporary occurrences, present in one generation and gone in the next, genes (replicators) are the only entity faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring. Viewing evolution as a struggle between competing replicators made it easier to recognize that not all genes in an organism would share the same evolutionary fate.<ref name="":25"" />

The gene's-eye view was a synthesis of the population genetic models of the modern synthesis, in particular the work of [[RA Fisher]], and the social evolution models of [[W. D. Hamilton]]. The view was popularized by  [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]''<ref name="":2"" /> and [[Richard Dawkins]]'s best seller ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''.<ref name=""TSG""/> Dawkins summarized a key benefit from the gene's-eye view as follows:

<blockquote>""If we allow ourselves the license of talking about genes as if they had conscious aims, always reassuring ourselves that we could translate our sloppy language back into respectable terms if we wanted to, we can ask the question, what is a single selfish gene trying to do?""  — Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene''<ref name=""TSG""/>{{rp|p. 88}}</blockquote>

In 1980, two high profile papers published back-to-back in ''Nature'' by Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick, and by Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza, brought the study of selfish genetic elements to the centre of biological debate.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":4"" /> The papers took their starting point in the contemporary debate of the so-called [[C-value|C-value paradox]], the lack of correlation between genome size and perceived complexity of a species. Both papers attempted to counter the prevailing view of the time that the presence of differential amounts of non-coding DNA and transposable elements is best explained from the perspective of individual fitness, described as the ""phenotypic paradigm"" by Doolittle and Sapienza. Instead, the authors argued that much of the genetic material in eukaryotic genomes persists, not because of its phenotypic effects, but can be understood from a gene's-eye view, without invoking individual-level explanations. The two papers led to a series of exchanges in ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cavalier-Smith T | title = How selfish is DNA? | journal = Nature | volume = 285 | issue = 5767 | pages = 617–8 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7393317 | doi = 10.1038/285617a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.285..617C | s2cid = 27111068 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover G | title = Ignorant DNA? | journal = Nature | volume = 285 | issue = 5767 | pages = 618–20 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7393318 | doi = 10.1038/285618a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.285..618D | s2cid = 4261755 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover G, Doolittle WF | title = Modes of genome evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 288 | issue = 5792 | pages = 646–7 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 6256636 | doi = 10.1038/288646a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.288..646D | s2cid = 8938434 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE, Crick FH, Sapienza C | title = Selfish DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 288 | issue = 5792 | pages = 645–6 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 7453798 | doi = 10.1038/288645a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.288..645O | s2cid = 4370178 }}</ref>

=== Current views ===
If the selfish DNA papers marked the beginning of the serious study of selfish genetic elements, the subsequent decades have seen an explosion in theoretical advances and empirical discoveries. [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] wrote a landmark review about the conflict between maternally inherited cytoplasmic genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes.<ref name="":20"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosmides LM, Tooby J | title = Cytoplasmic inheritance and intragenomic conflict | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–129 | date = March 1981 | pmid = 7278311 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(81)90181-8 | bibcode = 1981JThBi..89...83M }}</ref> The paper also provided a comprehensive introduction to the logic of genomic conflicts, foreshadowing many themes that would later be subject of much research. Then in 1988 [[John H. Werren]] and colleagues wrote the first major empirical review of the topic.<ref name="":0"" /> This paper achieved three things. First, it coined the term selfish genetic element, putting an end to a sometimes confusingly diverse terminology (selfish genes, ultra-selfish genes, selfish DNA, parasitic DNA, genomic outlaws). Second, it formally defined the concept of selfish genetic elements. Finally, it was the first paper to bring together all different kinds of selfish genetic elements known at the time ([[genomic imprinting]], for example, was not covered).<ref name="":0"" />

In the late 1980s, most molecular biologists considered selfish genetic elements to be the exception, and that genomes were best thought of as highly integrated networks with a coherent effect on organismal fitness.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":30"" /> In 2006, when [[Austin Burt]] and [[Robert Trivers]] published the first book-length treatment of the topic, the tide was changing.<ref name="":30"" /> While their role in evolution long remained controversial, in a review published a century after their first discovery, [[William R. Rice]] concluded that ""nothing in genetics makes sense except in the light of genomic conflicts"".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=William R. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2013-11-23|title=Nothing in Genetics Makes Sense Except in Light of Genomic Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=217–237|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160242|issn=1543-592X}}</ref>

== Logic ==
Though selfish genetic elements show a remarkable diversity in the way they promote their own transmission, some generalizations about their biology can be made. In a classic 2001 review, Gregory D.D. Hurst and John H. Werren proposed two ‘rules' of selfish genetic elements.<ref name="":1"" />

=== Rule 1: Spread requires sex and outbreeding ===
Sexual reproduction involves the mixing of genes from two individuals. According to [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's Law of Segregation]], alleles in a sexually reproducing organism have a 50% chance of being passed from parent to offspring. Meiosis is therefore sometimes referred to as ""fair"".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levinton|first=Jeffrey | name-list-style = vanc |date= June 1972 |title=Adaptation and Diversity.

Highly self-fertilizing or asexual genomes are expected to experience less conflict between selfish genetic elements and the rest of the host genome than outcrossing sexual genomes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hickey |first=Donal A. | name-list-style = vanc |date=October 1984 |title=DNA can be a selfish parasite |journal=Nature|volume=311|issue=5985|pages=417–418|doi=10.1038/311417d0|bibcode=1984Natur.311..417H |s2cid=4362210 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright S, Finnegan D | title = Genome evolution: sex and the transposable element | journal = Current Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = R296–9 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11369217 | doi = 10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00168-3 | s2cid = 2088287 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Stephen I. |last2=Schoen |first2=Daniel J. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Transposon dynamics and the breeding system|date=2000| work=Transposable Elements and Genome Evolution|volume=107 |issue=1–3 |pages=139–148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pmid=10952207 |isbn=9789401058124 }}</ref> There are several reasons for this. First, sex and outcrossing put selfish genetic elements into new genetic lineages. In contrast, in a highly selfing or asexual lineage, any selfish genetic element is essentially stuck in that lineage, which should increase variation in fitness among individuals. The increased variation should result in stronger purifying selection in selfers/asexuals, as a lineage without the selfish genetic elements should out-compete a lineage with the selfish genetic element. Second, the increased homozygosity in selfers removes the opportunity for competition among homologous alleles. Third, theoretical work has shown that the greater linkage disequilibrium in selfing compared to outcrossing genomes may in some, albeit rather limited, cases cause selection for reduced transposition rates.<ref name="":13"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth B, Langley CH | title = The evolution of self-regulated transposition of transposable elements | journal = Genetics | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–83 | date = February 1986 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/112.2.359 | pmid = 3000868 | pmc = 1202706 }}</ref> Overall, this reasoning leads to the prediction that asexuals/selfers should experience a lower load of selfish genetic elements. One caveat to this is that the evolution of selfing is associated with a reduction in the [[effective population size]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordborg M | title = Linkage disequilibrium, gene trees and selfing: an ancestral recombination graph with partial self-fertilization | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 923–9 | date = February 2000 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/154.2.923 | pmid = 10655241 | pmc = 1460950 }}</ref> A reduction in the effective population size should reduce the efficacy of selection and therefore leads to the opposite prediction: higher accumulation of selfish genetic elements in selfers relative to outcrossers.

=== Rule 2: Presence is often revealed in hybrids ===

The presence of selfish genetic elements can be difficult to detect in natural populations. Instead, their phenotypic consequences often become apparent in hybrids. The first reason for this is that some selfish genetic elements rapidly sweep to fixation, and the phenotypic effects will therefore not be segregating in the population. Hybridization events, however, will produce offspring with and without the selfish genetic elements and so reveal their presence. The second reason is that host genomes have evolved mechanisms to suppress the activity of the selfish genetic elements, for example the small RNA administered silencing of transposable elements.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aravin AA, Hannon GJ, Brennecke J | title = The Piwi-piRNA pathway provides an adaptive defense in the transposon arms race | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 761–4 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975059 | doi = 10.1126/science.1146484 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318..761A | doi-access = free }}</ref> The co-evolution between selfish genetic elements and their suppressors can be rapid, and follow a [[Red Queen hypothesis|Red Queen dynamics]], which may mask the presence of selfish genetic elements in a population.

== Examples ==

=== Segregation distorters ===
[[File:Segregation distorters.png|thumb|Segregation distorters (here shown in red) get transmitted to >50% of the gametes.]]
Some selfish genetic elements manipulate the [[W:Transmission (genetics)|genetic transmission process]]  to their own advantage, and so end up being overrepresented in the gametes. Such distortion can occur in various ways, and the umbrella term that encompasses all of them is segregation distortion. Some elements can preferentially be transmitted in egg cells as opposed to [[polar body|polar bodies]] during meiosis, where only the former will be fertilized and transmitted to the next generation. Any gene that can manipulate the odds of ending up in the egg rather than the polar body will have a transmission advantage, and will increase in frequency in a population.<ref name="":21"" />

Segregation distortion can happen in several ways. When this process occurs during meiosis it is referred to as [[W:meiotic drive|meiotic drive]]. Many forms of segregation distortion occur in male gamete formation, where there is differential mortality of spermatids during the process of sperm maturation or [[W:Spermiogenesis|spermiogenesis]]. The segregation distorter (SD) in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' is the best studied example, and it involves a nuclear envelope protein Ran-GAP and the X-linked repeat array called Responder (Rsp), where the SD allele of Ran-GAP favors its own transmission only in the presence of a Rsp<sup>sensitive</sup> allele on the homologous chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brittnacher JG, Ganetzky B | title = On the components of segregation distortion in Drosophila melanogaster.

When segregation distortion acts on sex chromosomes, they can skew the sex ratio. The SR system in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'', for example, is on the X chromosome, and XSR/Y males produce only daughters, whereas females undergo normal meiosis with Mendelian proportions of gametes.<ref name="":11"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtsinger JW, Feldman MW | title = Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of the ""Sex-Ratio"" Polymorphism in Drosophila pseudoobscura | journal = Genetics | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 445–66 | date = February 1980 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/94.2.445 | pmid = 17249004 | pmc = 1214151 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtsinger JW | title = Artificial selection on the sex ratio in Drosophila pseudoobscura | journal = Journal of Heredity | date = 1981 | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–381 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109535 }}</ref> Segregation distortion systems would drive the favored allele to fixation, except that most of the cases where these systems have been identified have the driven allele opposed by some other selective force.

[[File:Homing endonucleases.png|thumb|Homing endonucleases can recognize a target sequence, cut it, and then use its own sequence as a template during double strand break repair. This converts a heterozygote into a homozygote.]]

=== Transposable elements ===
[[File:Transposable elements (2).png|thumb|Transposable elements self-replicate through two main mechanisms: via an RNA intermediate (""copy-and-paste""; class 1) or straight excision-insertion (""cut-and-paste""; class 2).]]
Transposable elements (TEs) include a wide variety of DNA sequences that all have the ability to move to new locations in the genome of their host. Transposons do this by a direct cut-and-paste mechanism, whereas retrotransposons need to produce an RNA intermediate to move. TEs were first discovered in maize by [[Barbara McClintock]] in the 1940s<ref name="":8"" /> and their ability to occur in both active and quiescent states in the genome was also first elucidated by McClintock.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravindran S | title = Barbara McClintock and the discovery of jumping genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20198–9 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23236127 | pmc = 3528533 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1219372109 | doi-access = free }}</ref> TEs have been referred to as selfish genetic elements because they have some control over their own propagation in the genome.

Both plant and animal hosts have evolved means for reducing the fitness impact of TEs, both by directly silencing them and by reducing their ability to transpose in the genome. It would appear that hosts in general are fairly tolerant of TEs in their genomes, since a sizable portion (30-80%) of the genome of many animals and plants is TEs.<ref name="":18"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ågren JA, Wright SI | title = Co-evolution between transposable elements and their hosts: a major factor in genome size evolution? | journal = Chromosome Research  | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 777–86 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21850458 | doi = 10.1007/s10577-011-9229-0 | s2cid = 25148109 }}</ref><ref name="":19"">T{{cite journal | vauthors = Tenaillon MI, Hollister JD, Gaut BS | title = A triptych of the evolution of plant transposable elements | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 471–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20541961 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2010.05.003 }}</ref> When the host is able to stop their movement, TEs can simply be frozen in place, and it then can take millions of years for them to mutate away.

The effect of TEs in the genome is not entirely selfish. Because their insertion into the genome can disrupt gene function, sometimes those disruptions can have positive fitness value for the host.

=== Selfish mitochondria ===
Genomic conflicts often arise because not all genes are inherited in the same way. Probably the best example of this is the conflict between [[Uniparental inheritance|uniparentally]] (usually but not always, maternally) inherited mitochondrial and biparentally inherited nuclear genes. Indeed, one of the earliest clear statements about the possibility of genomic conflict was made by the English botanist Dan Lewis in reference to the conflict between maternally inherited mitochondrial and biparentally inherited nuclear genes over sex allocation in [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] plants.<ref name="":7"" />

A single cell typically contains multiple mitochondria, creating a situation for competition over transmission. Uniparental inheritance has been suggested to be a way to reduce the opportunity for selfish mitochondria to spread, as it ensures all mitochondria share the same genome, thus removing the opportunity for competition.<ref name="":20"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hadjivasiliou Z, Lane N, Seymour RM, Pomiankowski A | title = Dynamics of mitochondrial inheritance in the evolution of binary mating types and two sexes | journal = Proceedings.

=== Genomic imprinting ===
[[File:Imprt.png|thumb|''Igf2''&nbsp;is an example of genomic imprinting. In mice, the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene,&nbsp;''Igf2'', which is linked to hormone production and increased offspring growth is paternally expressed (maternally silenced) and the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor gene&nbsp;''Igf2r'', which binds the growth protein and so slows growth, is maternally expressed (paternally silenced).&nbsp;The offspring is normal sized when both genes are present, or both genes are absent. When the maternally expressed gene (''Igf2r'') is experimentally knocked out the offspring has an unusually large size, and when the paternally expressed gene (''Igf2'') is knocked out, the offspring is unusually small.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlow DP, Bartolomei MS | title = Genomic imprinting in mammals | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = a018382 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24492710 | pmc = 3941233 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a018382 }}</ref>]]
Another sort of conflict that genomes face is that between the mother and father competing for control of gene expression in the offspring, including the complete silencing of one parental allele. Due to differences in methylation status of gametes, there is an inherent asymmetry to the maternal and paternal genomes that can be used to drive a differential parent-of-origin expression. This results in a violation of Mendel's rules at the level of expression, not transmission, but if the gene expression affects fitness, it can amount to a similar end result.<ref name="":22"" />

Imprinting seems like a maladaptive phenomenon, since it essentially means giving up diploidy, and heterozygotes for one defective allele are in trouble if the active allele is the one that is silenced. Several human diseases, such as [[Prader–Willi syndrome|Prader-Willi]] and [[Angelman syndrome|Angelman]] syndromes, are associated with defects in imprinted genes. The asymmetry of maternal and paternal expression suggests that some kind of conflict between these two genomes might be driving the evolution of imprinting. In particular, several genes in placental mammals display expression of paternal genes that maximize offspring growth, and maternal genes that tend to keep that growth in check. Many other conflict-based theories about the evolution of genomic imprinting have been put forward.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore T, Haig D | title = Genomic imprinting in mammalian development: a parental tug-of-war | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–9 | date = February 1991 | pmid = 2035190 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(91)90230-N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haig D | title = Coadaptation and conflict, misconception and muddle, in the evolution of genomic imprinting | journal = Heredity | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 96–103 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24129605 | pmc = 4105449 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.2013.97 }}</ref>

At the same time, genomic or sexual conflict are not the only possible mechanisms whereby imprinting can evolve.<ref name="":22"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer HG, Clark AG | title = Non-conflict theories for the evolution of genomic imprinting | journal = Heredity | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 112–8 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24398886 | pmc = 4105448 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.2013.129 }}</ref> Several molecular mechanisms for genomic imprinting have been described, and all have the aspect that maternally and paternally derived alleles are made to have distinct epigenetic marks, in particular the degree of methylation of cytosines. An important point to note regarding genomic imprinting is that it is quite heterogeneous, with different mechanisms and different consequences of having single parent-of-origin expression. For example, examining the imprinting status of closely related species allows one to see that a gene that is moved by an inversion into close proximity of imprinted genes may itself acquire an imprinted status, even if there is no particular fitness consequence of the imprinting.<ref name="":22"" />

=== Greenbeards ===
A [[Green-beard effect|greenbeard gene]] is a gene that has the ability to recognize copies of itself in other individuals and then make its carrier act preferentially toward such individuals. The name itself comes from thought-experiment first presented by Bill Hamilton<ref name="":27"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

The point of the thought experiment was to highlight that from a gene's-eye view, it is not the genome-wide relatedness that matters (which is usually how kin selection operates, i.e. cooperative behavior is directed towards relatives), but the relatedness at the particular locus that underlies the social behavior.<ref name=""TSG"" /><ref name="":27"" />

[[File:GreenbeardsAug18.png|thumb|The simplest form of greenbeard mechanism. An individual with the greenbeard allele preferentially helps a fellow greenbeard individual.]]

Following Dawkins, a greenbeard is usually defined as a gene, or set of closely linked genes, that has three effects:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner A, West SA | title = Greenbeards | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–38 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19780812 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00842.x | s2cid = 221733134 }}</ref>

== Consequences to the host ==

=== Species extinction ===
Perhaps one of the clearest ways to see that the process of natural selection does not always have organismal fitness as the sole driver is when selfish genetic elements have their way without restriction. In such cases, selfish elements can, in principle, result in species extinction. This possibility was pointed out already in 1928 by Sergey Gershenson<ref name="":5"" /> and then in 1967, [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton WD | title = Extraordinary sex ratios.

In particular, if a selfish element should be able to direct the production of sperm, such that males bearing the element on the Y chromosome would produce an excess of Y-bearing sperm, then in the absence of any countervailing force, this would ultimately result in the Y chromosome going to fixation in the population, producing an extremely male-biased sex ratio. In ecologically challenged species, such biased sex ratios imply that the conversion of resources to offspring becomes very inefficient, to the point of risking extinction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allee effects in ecology and conservation|last=Franck.|first=Courchamp|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199567553|oclc=929797557}}</ref>

An early striking example of hybrid dysgenesis induced by a selfish genetic element was the ''P'' element in ''Drosophila''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Engels WR | title = The origin of P elements in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = BioEssays | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 681–6 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1285420 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950141007 | s2cid = 20741333 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kidwell MG | title = Evolution of hybrid dysgenesis determinants in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 80 | issue = 6 | pages = 1655–9 | date = March 1983 | pmid = 6300863 | pmc = 393661 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.80.6.1655| bibcode = 1983PNAS...80.1655K | doi-access = free }}</ref> If males carrying the ''P'' element were crossed to females lacking it, the resulting offspring suffered from reduced fitness.

The presence of an abundance of transposable elements in many eukaryotic genomes was a central theme of the original selfish DNA papers mentioned above (See [[#Conceptual developments|Conceptual developments]]). Most people quickly accepted the central message of those papers, that the existence of transposable elements can be explained by selfish selection at the gene level and there is no need to invoke individual level selection. However, the idea that organisms keep transposable elements around as genetic reservoir to ""speed up evolution"" or for other regulatory functions persists in some quarters.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fedoroff NV | title = Presidential address.

== Applications in agriculture and biotechnology ==

=== Cytoplasmic male sterility in plant breeding ===
A common problem for plant breeders is unwanted self-fertilization. This is particularly a problem when breeders try to cross two different strains to create a new hybrid strain. One way to avoid this is manual emasculation, i.e. physically removing anthers to render the individual male sterile. Cytoplasmic male sterility offers an alternative to this laborious exercise.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RP, Pring DR | title = Nuclear-mediated mitochondrial gene regulation and male fertility in higher plants: Light at the end of the tunnel? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 16 | pages = 10240–2 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12149484 | pmc = 124896 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.172388899 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9910240W | doi-access = free }}</ref> Breeders cross a strain that carries a cytoplasmic male sterility mutation with a strain that does not, the latter acting as the pollen donor. If the hybrid offspring are to be harvested for their seed (like maize), and therefore needs to be male fertile, the parental strains need to be homozygous for the restorer allele. In contrast, in species that harvested for their vegetable parts, like onions, this is not an issue. This technique has been used in a wide variety of crops, including rice, maize, sunflower, wheat, and cotton.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohra A, Jha UC, Adhimoolam P, Bisht D, Singh NP | title = Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in hybrid breeding in field crops | journal = Plant Cell Reports | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 967–93 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26905724 | doi = 10.1007/s00299-016-1949-3 | s2cid = 15935454 }}</ref>

=== PiggyBac vectors ===
While many transposable elements seem to do no good for the host, some transposable elements have been ""tamed"" by molecular biologists so that the elements can be made to insert and excise at the will of the scientist. Such elements are especially useful for doing genetic manipulations, like inserting foreign DNA into the genomes of a variety of organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryder E, Russell S | title = Transposable elements as tools for genomics and genetics in Drosophila | journal = Briefings in Functional Genomics & Proteomics | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–71 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 15239944 | doi = 10.1093/bfgp/2.1.57 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

One excellent example of this is [[PiggyBac Transposon System|PiggyBac]], a transposable element that can efficiently move between cloning vectors and chromosomes using a ""cut and paste"" mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser MJ, Ciszczon T, Elick T, Bauser C | title = Precise excision of TTAA-specific lepidopteran transposons piggyBac (IFP2) and tagalong (TFP3) from the baculovirus genome in cell lines from two species of Lepidoptera | journal = Insect Molecular Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–51 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8673264 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2583.1996.tb00048.x| s2cid = 42758313 }}</ref> The investigator constructs a PiggyBac element with the desired payload spliced in, and a second element (the PiggyBac transposase), located on another plasmid vector, can be co-transfected into the target cell. The PiggyBac transposase cuts at the inverted terminal repeat sequences located on both ends of the PiggyBac vector and efficiently moves the contents from the original sites and integrates them into chromosomal positions where the sequence TTAA is found. The three things that make PiggyBac so useful are the remarkably high efficiency of this cut-and-paste operation, its ability to take payloads up to 200 kb in size, and its ability to leave a perfectly seamless cut from a genomic site, leaving no sequences or mutations behind.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yusa K | title = Seamless genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells using custom endonuclease-based gene targeting and the piggyBac transposon | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 2061–78 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24071911 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.126 | s2cid = 12746945 }}</ref>

=== CRISPR gene drive and homing endonuclease systems ===
[[CRISPR]] allows the construction of artificial homing endonucleases, where the construct produces guide RNAs that cut the target gene, and homologous flanking sequences then allow insertion of the same construct harboring the Cas9 gene and the guide RNAs. Such gene drives ought to have the ability to rapidly spread in a population (see [[#Gene drive systems|Gene drive systems]]), and one practical application of such a system that has been proposed is to apply it to a pest population, greatly reducing its numbers or even driving it extinct.<ref name="":17"" /> This has not yet been attempted in the field, but gene drive constructs have been tested in the lab, and the ability to insert into the wild-type homologous allele in heterozygotes for the gene drive has been demonstrated.<ref name="":16"" /> Unfortunately, the double-strand break that is introduced by Cas9 can be corrected by [[homology directed repair]], which would make a perfect copy of the drive, or by [[non-homologous end joining]], which would produce ""resistant"" alleles unable to further propagate themselves. When Cas9 is expressed outside of meiosis, it seems like non-homologous end joining predominates, making this the biggest hurdle to practical application of gene drives.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Champer J, Reeves R, Oh SY, Liu C, Liu J, Clark AG, Messer PW | title = Novel CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive constructs reveal insights into mechanisms of resistance allele formation and drive efficiency in genetically diverse populations | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = e1006796 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28727785 | pmc = 5518997 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006796}}</ref>

== Mathematical theory ==
Much of the confusion regarding ideas about selfish genetic elements center on the use of language and the way the elements and their evolutionary dynamics are described.<ref name="":24"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner A, Welch JJ | title = A formal theory of the selfish gene | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1801–13 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21605218 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02310.x | s2cid = 14477476 }}</ref> Mathematical models allow the assumptions and the rules to be given ''a priori'' for establishing mathematical statements about the expected dynamics of the elements in populations. The consequences of having such elements in genomes can then be explored objectively. The mathematics can define very crisply the different classes of elements by their precise behavior within a population, sidestepping any distracting verbiage about the inner hopes and desires of greedy selfish genes. There are many good examples of this approach, and this article focuses on segregation distorters, gene drive systems and transposable elements.<ref name="":24"" />

=== Segregation distorters ===
The mouse t-allele is a classic example of a segregation distorter system that has been modeled in great detail.<ref name="":14"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewontin RC, Dunn LC | title = The Evolutionary Dynamics of a Polymorphism in the House Mouse | journal = Genetics | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 705–22 | date = June 1960 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/45.6.705 | pmid = 17247957 | pmc = 1210083 }}</ref> Heterozygotes for a t-haplotype produce >90% of their gametes bearing the t (see [[#Segregation distorters|Segregation distorters]]), and homozygotes for a t-haplotype die as embryos. This can result in a stable polymorphism, with an equilibrium frequency that depends on the drive strength and direct fitness impacts of t-haplotypes. This is a common theme in the mathematics of segregation distorters:virtually every example we know entails a countervailing selective effect, without which the allele with biased transmission would go to fixation and the segregation distortion would no longer be manifested. Whenever sex chromosomes undergo segregation distortion, the population sex ratio is altered, making these systems particularly interesting. Two classic examples of segregation distortion involving sex chromosomes include the ""Sex Ratio"" X chromosomes of ''Drosophila pseudoobscura''<ref name="":11"" /> and Y chromosome drive suppressors of ''Drosophila mediopunctata''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carvalho AB, Vaz SC, Klaczko LB | title = Polymorphism for Y-linked suppressors of sex-ratio in two natural populations of Drosophila mediopunctata | journal = Genetics | volume = 146 | issue = 3 | pages = 891–902 | date = July 1997 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/146.3.891 | pmid = 9215895 | pmc = 1208059 }}</ref> A crucial point about the theory of segregation distorters is that just because there are fitness effects acting against the distorter, this does not guarantee that there will be a stable polymorphism. In fact, some sex chromosome drivers can produce frequency dynamics with wild oscillations and cycles.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark AG | title = Natural selection and Y-linked polymorphism | journal = Genetics | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 569–77 | date = March 1987 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/115.3.569 | pmid = 3569883 | pmc = 1216358 }}</ref>

=== Gene drive systems ===
The idea of spreading a gene into a population as a means of population control is actually quite old, and models for the dynamics of introduced compound chromosomes date back to the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitz-Earle M, Holm DG, Suzuki DT | title = Genetic control of insect population. I. Cage studies of chromosome replacement by compound autosomes in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 461–75 | date = July 1973 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/74.3.461 | pmid = 4200686 | pmc = 1212962 }}</ref> Subsequently, the population genetics theory for homing endonucleases and CRISPR-based gene drives has become much more advanced.<ref name="":15"" /><ref name="":28"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deredec A, Burt A, Godfray HC | title = The population genetics of using homing endonuclease genes in vector and pest management | journal = Genetics | volume = 179 | issue = 4 | pages = 2013–26 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18660532 | pmc = 2516076 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.089037 }}</ref> An important component of modeling these processes in natural populations is to consider the genetic response in the target population. For one thing, any natural population will harbor standing genetic variation, and that variation might well include polymorphism in the sequences homologous to the guide RNAs, or the homology arms that are meant to direct the repair. In addition, different hosts and different constructs may have quite different rates of non-homologous end joining, the form of repair that results in broken or resistant alleles that no longer spread. Full accommodation of the host factors presents considerable challenge for getting a gene drive construct to go to fixation, and Unckless and colleagues<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unckless RL, Clark AG, Messer PW | title = Evolution of Resistance Against CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Drive | journal = Genetics | volume = 205 | issue = 2 | pages = 827–841 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27941126 | pmc = 5289854 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.116.197285}}</ref> show that in fact the current constructs are quite far from being able to attain even moderate frequencies in natural populations. This is another excellent example showing that just because an element appears to have a strong selfish transmission advantage, whether it can successfully spread may depend on subtle configurations of other parameters in the population.<ref name="":28"" />

=== Transposable elements ===
To model the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) within a genome, one has to realize that the elements behave like a population within each genome, and they can jump from one haploid genome to another by horizontal transfer. The mathematics has to describe the rates and dependencies of these transfer events. It was observed early on that the rate of jumping of many TEs varies with copy number, and so the first models simply used an empirical function for the rate of transposition. This had the advantage that it could be measured by experiments in the lab, but it left open the question of why the rate differs among elements and differs with copy number. Stan Sawyer and Daniel L. Hartl<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sawyer S, Hartl D | title = Distribution of transposable elements in prokaryotes | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3018953 | doi = 10.1016/0040-5809(86)90021-3}}</ref> fitted models of this sort to a variety of bacterial TEs, and obtained quite good fits between copy number and transmission rate and the population-wide incidence of the TEs. TEs in higher organisms, like ''Drosophila'', have a very different dynamics because of sex, and [[Brian Charlesworth]], [[Deborah Charlesworth]], Charles Langley, John Brookfield and others<ref name="":13"" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brookfield JF, Badge RM | title = Population genetics models of transposable elements | journal = Genetica | volume = 100 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 281–94 | date = 1997 | pmid = 9440281 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018310418744| s2cid = 40644313 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth B, Charlesworth D | title = The population dynamics of transposable elements. | journal = Genet.

What is impressive about all these modeling efforts is how well they fitted empirical data, given that this was decades before discovery of the fact that the host fly has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of piRNAs. Incorporation of host defense along with TE dynamics into evolutionary models of TE regulation is still in its infancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu J, Clark AG | title = Population dynamics of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their targets in Drosophila | journal = Genome Research | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–27 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19948818 | pmc = 2813477 | doi = 10.1101/gr.095406.109 }}</ref>

== Background ==
Christine Merlin was born on September 24, 1980 in southwestern France. She attended [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in Paris, where she received a BS in animal biology, an MS in invertebrate physiology, and finally her PhD in insect physiology in 2006.<ref name="":3"" /> She studied circadian rhythms in moths in Versailles at the [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique|National Institute for Research on Agronomy]] in the lab of Emmanuelle Jacquin-Joly and Martine Maibeche-Coisne while studying for her doctorate. In 2007, she began working in the lab of [[Steven M. Reppert|Steven Reppert]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. There, she studied the migration of monarch butterflies, established reverse genetics in this new model system, and collaborated on a paper outlining the monarch genome.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web|last=Daugherty|first=McKensie|title=Faculty Page: Christine Merlin|url=https://www.bio.tamu.edu/faculty-page-christine-merlin/|access-date=2021-05-05|website=Texas A&M Biology|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="":7"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Merlin|first1=Christine|last2=Beaver|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Taylor|first3=Orley R.|last4=Wolfe|first4=Scot A.|last5=Reppert|first5=Steven M.|date=2013-01-01|title=Efficient targeted mutagenesis in the monarch butterfly using zinc-finger nucleases|url=https://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/1/159|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=159–168|doi=10.1101/gr.145599.112|issn=1088-9051|pmid=23009861|pmc=3530676}}</ref>

In 2013, she became an assistant professor of biology at Texas A&M University, where she works now. She joined the Center of Biological Clocks Research as a faculty member studying biology, specifically the circadian clock regulation of monarch butterfly migration. She also became a faculty member of Texas A&M's Genetics and Neuroscience interdisciplinary program in 2014, as well as their Ecology and Evolutionary Biology interdisciplinary program in 2015.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":7"" />

=== The migration of monarch butterflies and its control by circadian clocks ===
Monarch butterflies use the [[Sun compass in animals|sun as a compass]] to precisely orient themselves across long distances during migration.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Pennisi|first1=Elizabeth|date=2019-12-18|title=Mysterious monarch migrations may be triggered by the angle of the Sun|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/12/mysterious-monarch-migrations-may-be-triggered-angle-sun|access-date=2021-05-06|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en}}</ref><ref name="":4"">{{Cite journal|last1=Reppert|first1=Steven M.|last2=de Roode|first2=Jacobus C.|date=2018-09-10|title=Demystifying Monarch Butterfly Migration|journal=Current Biology |volume=28|issue=17|pages=R1009–R1022|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.067|issn=1879-0445|pmid=30205052|doi-access=free}}</ref> Merlin and colleagues determined that circadian clocks located in the [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e play a significant role in navigation in migratory monarch butterflies.<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal|last1=Merlin|first1=Christine|last2=Gegear|first2=Robert J.|last3=Reppert|first3=Steven M.|date=2009-09-25|title=Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5948|pages=1700–1704|doi=10.1126/science.1176221|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2754321|pmid=19779201|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1700M}}</ref> Using tests of [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessity]], Merlin and colleagues analyzed migratory butterfly orientation with intact antennae, without antennae, or with antennae coated with black paint, and concluded that butterflies without antennae or with antennae harboring desynchronized antennal clocks (coated black) were unable to orient relative to the sun.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Buchen|first=Lizzie|date=2009-09-24|title=Butterflies' migrational timekeeper found|work=Nature|url=https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090924/full/news.2009.946.html}}</ref> She isolated butterfly antennae ''[[in vitro]]'' and discovered that they sustained 24-hour rhythms in constant conditions after [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] to light-dark cycles. By measuring expression of clock genes [[Period (gene)|Per]], [[Timeless (gene)|Tim]], and [[CRY2|Cry2]], Merlin determined that a circadian clock exists in the monarch antennae, functioning independently of the brain clock.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":5"" />

Monarch butterflies use a time-compensated sun compass that is a part of the insect's light-entrained circadian clocks located in the antennae.<ref name="":5"" /> Merlin and colleagues conducted a test of [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficiency]] to determine if one or both antennae are needed to properly orient. They found that either antenna can be sufficient for time compensation, but surprisingly that butterflies with one of their antennae painted black and the other painted clear had disoriented flight.<ref name="":4"" /><ref name="":6"">{{Cite journal|last1=Guerra|first1=Patrick A.|last2=Merlin|first2=Christine|last3=Gegear|first3=Robert J.|last4=Reppert|first4=Steven M.|date=2012-07-17|title=Discordant timing between antennae disrupts sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=958|doi=10.1038/ncomms1965|pmid=22805565|pmc=3962218|bibcode=2012NatCo...3..958G|issn=2041-1723}}</ref> In this experimental condition, the antenna painted black would block entrainment from light cues while the antenna painted clear would allow entrainment from light cues. When the black-painted antenna from this experimental condition was ablated, the butterfly would then be able to properly orient by using just the single clear-painted antenna to entrain.<ref name="":4"" /> The team also observed that Per and Tim gene expression was highly rhythmic in the clear-painted antennae, but disrupted in the black-painted antennae.<ref name="":6"" /> Merlin and coworkers concluded that each antenna has its own clock outputs that are then processed together in the sun compass to direct the orientation of flight.

In 2011, Merlin (along with Steven Reppert, Shuai Zhan, and Jeffrey Boore) contributed to outlining the genome of the migratory monarch butterfly and described the operation of circadian clocks as a method of regulating migration. The monarch clock relies on a [[Transcription translation feedback loop|transcription-translation feedback loop]] (TTFL) that contains many of the same genetic components as the clocks of other [[arthropod]]s, such as ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Allada|first1=Ravi|last2=Chung|first2=Brian Y.|date=2010-03-17|title=Circadian Organization of Behavior and Physiology in Drosophila|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=605–624|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135815|issn=0066-4278|pmc=2887282|pmid=20148690}}</ref> One notable difference between the monarch clock and the ''Drosophila melanogaster'' clock is the appearance of both a light-sensitive [[CRY1]] and a transcriptionally repressive CRY2 in the monarch clock, while ''Drosophila melanogaster'' only contains CRY1.<ref name="":10"">{{Cite journal|date=2011-11-23|title=The Monarch Butterfly Genome Yields Insights into Long-Distance Migration|journal=Cell|language=en|volume=147|issue=5|pages=1171–1185|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.09.052|issn=0092-8674|pmc=3225893|last1=Zhan|first1=Shuai|last2=Merlin|first2=Christine|last3=Boore|first3=Jeffrey L.|last4=Reppert|first4=Steven M.|pmid=22118469}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Haisun|last2=Sauman|first2=Ivo|last3=Yuan|first3=Quan|last4=Casselman|first4=Amy|last5=Emery-Le|first5=Myai|last6=Emery|first6=Patrick|last7=Reppert|first7=Steven M.|date=2008-01-08|title=Cryptochromes Define a Novel Circadian Clock Mechanism in Monarch Butterflies That May Underlie Sun Compass Navigation|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=e4|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060004|issn=1545-7885|pmc=2174970|pmid=18184036}}</ref> As most arthropods have both CRY types, this result provided additional evidence that both CRY were at “the base of arthropod evolution.” They highlighted two main uses for the clock. One use is for sun compass orientation, which allows the monarch to navigate towards its destination by detecting the horizontal position of the sun and the polarized skylight patterns produced. The other use is for the initiation of migration by detecting decreasing day length in the autumn.<ref name="":10"" />

=== Genetic editing: TALENs & CRISPR/Cas9 ===
Merlin and her lab have been consistently interested in exploring methods of selective genetic editing via tools such as [[zinc finger]] proteins, which enable the creation of targeted [[gene knockout]]s within a specified locus. In 2016, Merlin and colleagues demonstrated that both [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] and [[CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing|CRISPR/Cas9]] technologies could be utilized in a similar manner to create highly efficient, heritable, targeted [[mutagenesis]] at selected genomic loci.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal|last1=Markert|first1=Matthew J|last2=Zhang|first2=Ying|last3=Enuameh|first3=Metewo S|last4=Reppert|first4=Steven M|last5=Wolfe|first5=Scot A|last6=Merlin|first6=Christine|date=2016-04-01|title=Genomic Access to Monarch Migration Using TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Targeted Mutagenesis|url=https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.116.027029|journal=G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics|volume=6|issue=4|pages=905–915|doi=10.1534/g3.116.027029|pmid=26837953|issn=2160-1836|pmc=4825660}}</ref> Merlin and her team were able to generate genetic knockouts of the Cry2 and [[CLOCK|Clk]] genes within the monarch genome, two notable clock genes responsible in part for the regulation and modulation of the monarch circadian clock. These knockouts were shown to be heritable, with the injection of less than 100 eggs being sufficient to recover mutant progeny; enabling the generation of mutant knockout lines in around 3 months.<ref name="":0"" /> These findings provided new research methods for the genetic manipulation and study of monarch clock genes, as is currently being explored by the Merlin Lab.

=== Monarch migration, photoperiodic induction and genetics ===
While researching monarchs, Merlin headed a paper alongside graduate students Samantha E. Liams and Aldrin B. Lugena and delved into a deeper understanding of monarch migration, its concomitant photoperiodic induction of [[diapause]], and the underlying genetic components.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last1=Merlin|first1=Christine|last2=Iiams|first2=Samantha E.|last3=Lugena|first3=Aldrin B.|date=2020-09-01|title=Monarch Butterfly Migration Moving into the Genetic Era|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(20)30157-8|journal=Trends in Genetics|language=English|volume=36|issue=9|pages=689–701|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2020.06.011|issn=0168-9525|pmid=32713598|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhan|first1=Shuai|last2=Zhang|first2=Wei|last3=Niitepõld|first3=Kristjan|last4=Hsu|first4=Jeremy|last5=Haeger|first5=Juan Fernández|last6=Zalucki|first6=Myron P.|last7=Altizer|first7=Sonia|last8=de Roode|first8=Jacobus C.|last9=Reppert|first9=Steven M.|last10=Kronforst|first10=Marcus R.|date=2014-10-16|title=The genetics of monarch butterfly migration and warning coloration|journal=Nature|volume=514|issue=7522|pages=317–321|doi=10.1038/nature13812|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4331202|pmid=25274300|bibcode=2014Natur.514..317Z}}</ref> Monarchs who migrate in the fall experience a reproductive diapause response to prepare for their migration, which is triggered by the shortened days and colder temperatures of autumn.<ref name="":4"" /> In laboratory conditions, female monarchs produce less mature oocytes in short photoperiods than in long ones, and Merlin and colleagues genetically demonstrated the involvement of clock genes in the response. They also identified the [[vitamin A]] pathway in the brain as being differentially regulated in a photoperiod manner.<ref name="":2"" /> Using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of function mutant of gene nina B1, a gene that encodes the rate limiting enzyme that converts [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] into [[retinal]], they demonstrated the necessity of this pathway for the photoperiodic induction of reproductive diapause. As in other insects, diapause in monarchs is known to result from juvenile hormone deficiency in the corpora cardiaca-corpora allata complex, but the link between the hormone and vitamin A is currently unknown.<ref name="":2"" />

=== Magnetoreception ===
In 2021, Merlin was credited as assisting in a research article focused on the [[magnetoreception]] of monarch butterflies.<ref name="":12"">{{Cite journal|last1=Wan|first1=Guijun|last2=Hayden|first2=Ashley N.|last3=Iiams|first3=Samantha E.|last4=Merlin|first4=Christine|date=2021-02-03|title=Cryptochrome 1 mediates light-dependent inclination magnetosensing in monarch butterflies|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=771|doi=10.1038/s41467-021-21002-z|issn=2041-1723|pmc=7859408|pmid=33536422|bibcode=2021NatCo..12..771W}}</ref> While the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing has not yet been discovered, the connection to the [[photoexcitation]] of CRY proteins has been linked to both CRY1 in Drosophila and CRY2 in monarchs and humans.<ref name="":4"" /> This discovery in humans and monarchs was identified due to the finding that [[overexpression]] in CRY-deficient flies restored magnetosensitivity, suggesting they perform photochemical reactions for the magnetosensitivity in the fly's cellular environment.<ref name="":12"" /> In order to test reorientation using [[Magnetic dip|magnetic inclination]] in monarchs, both fall migrant monarchs and [[Wild type|wild-type]] laboratory monarchs were placed in a flight simulator that manipulated different magnetic field parameters: declination, inclination, and intensity. It was found that both variants of monarchs did not display hyperactivity to the [[geomagnetic field]], but both variants did display an increase in wingbeats upon reversing magnetic inclination. Creating a [https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095456352 behavioral assay] from this experiment led to the evaluation that the Drosophila CRY1 (dpCry1) was necessary for monarch light-dependent magnetoreception, while the Drosophila CRY2 (dpCry2) was not.<ref name="":12"" /> The antennae and compound eyes were tested to see if they were necessary for light-dependent magnetoreception. Blocking either one of these organs with black paint led to impaired responses to ambient magnetic inclination and reversal of ambient magnetic inclination. This indicates that the monarch's antennae and compound eyes are necessary for magnetosensing, and that impairing one of these organs cannot be compensated by the other.<ref name="":12"" />

=== Ongoing research ===
As of 2021, the Merlin lab is currently focused on utilizing [[Reverse genetics|reverse genetic]] tools to further unravel clockwork mechanisms in the monarch, determine how previously identified [[candidate gene]]s contribute to butterfly migration and photoperiodic sensing, as well as dissect the genetic basis of the magnetic sense.<ref name="":1"" /> The lab is currently working with known clock genes ''[[in vivo]]'' to understand circadian repressive mechanisms within the monarch and gain further knowledge regarding how insect clocks have evolved. Merlin is also exploring means to expand the monarch genetic toolbox with a focus on developing a reliable CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach to introduce [[Reporter gene|reporter tags]] into loci of interest within the monarch genome and gain insights into the clock circuitry in the brain.<ref name="":1"" />

Given their small size, sORFs were originally overlooked. However, hundreds of thousands of putative micropeptides have been identified through various techniques in a multitude of organisms. Only a small fraction of these with coding potential have had their expression and function confirmed. Those that have been functionally characterized, in general, have roles in [[cell signaling]], [[organogenesis]], and [[Cell physiology|cellular physiology]]. As more micropeptides are discovered so are more of their functions. One regulatory function is that of peptoswitches, which inhibit expression of downstream coding sequences by stalling [[ribosome]]s, through their direct or indirect activation by small molecules.<ref name="":6"" />

== Identification ==
Various experimental techniques exist for identifying potential s[[open reading frame|ORF]]s and their translational products. These techniques are only useful for identification of sORF that may produce micropeptides and not for direct functional characterization.

=== RNA sequencing ===
One method for finding potential sORFs, and therefore micropeptides, is through RNA sequencing ([[RNA-Seq]]). RNA-Seq uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine which RNAs are expressed in a given cell, tissue, or organism at a specific point in time. This collection of data, known as a [[transcriptome]], can then be used as a resource for finding potential sORFs.<ref name="":0"" /> Because of the strong likelihood of sORFs less than 100 aa occurring by chance, further study is necessary to determine the validity of data obtained using this method.<ref name="":6"" />

=== Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) ===
[[Ribosome profiling]] has been used to identify potential micropeptides in a growing number of organisms, including fruit flies, zebrafish, mice and humans.<ref name="":6"" /> One method uses compounds such as harringtonine, puromycin or lactimidomycin to stop ribosomes at translation initiation sites.<ref name="":7"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bazzini AA, Johnstone TG, Christiano R, Mackowiak SD, Obermayer B, Fleming ES, Vejnar CE, Lee MT, Rajewsky N, Walther TC, Giraldez AJ | title = Identification of small ORFs in vertebrates using ribosome footprinting and evolutionary conservation | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 981–93 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24705786 | pmc = 4193932 | doi = 10.1002/embj.201488411 }}</ref> This indicates where active translation is taking place.

=== Mass spectrometry ===
[[Mass spectrometry]] (MS) is the gold standard for identifying and sequencing proteins. Using this technique, investigators are able to determine if polypeptides are, in fact, translated from a sORF.

=== Proteogenomic applications ===
[[Proteogenomics]] combines proteomics, genomics, and transciptomics. This is important when looking for potential micropeptides. One method of using proteogenomics entails using RNA-Seq data to create a custom database of all possible polypeptides. Liquid chromatography followed by tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) is performed to provide sequence information for translation products. Comparison of the transcriptomic and proteomics data can be used to confirm the presence of micropeptides.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" />

=== Phylogenetic conservation ===
Phylogenetic conservation can be a useful tool, particularly when sifting through a large database of sORFs. The likelihood of a sORF resulting in a functional micropeptide is more likely if it is conserved across numerous species.<ref name="":6"" /><ref name="":7"" /> However, this will not work for all sORFs. For example, those that are encoded by lncRNAs are less likely to be conserved given lncRNAs themselves do not have high sequence conservation.<ref name="":1"" /> Further experimentation will be necessary to determine if a functional micropeptide is in fact produced.

== Validating protein-coding potential ==

=== Antibodies ===
Custom [[Antibody|antibodies]] targeted to the micropeptide of interest can be useful for quantifying expression or determining intracellular localization. As is the case with most proteins, low expression may make detection difficult. The small size of the micropeptide can also lead to difficulties in designing an epitope from which to target the antibody.<ref name="":1"" />

=== Tagging with CRISPR-Cas9 ===
[[Genome editing]] can be used to add FLAG/MYC or other small peptide tags to an endogenous sORF, thus creating fusion proteins. In most cases, this method is beneficial in that it can be performed more quickly than developing a custom antibody. It is also useful for micropeptides for which no epitope can be targeted.<ref name="":1"" />

=== In vitro translation ===
This process entails cloning the full-length micropeptide cDNA into a plasmid containing a T7 or SP6 promoter. This method utilizes a cell-free protein-synthesizing system in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine to produce the peptide of interest. The products can then be analyzed by gel electrophoresis and the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled peptide is visualized using autoradiography.<ref name="":1"" />

== Databases and repositories ==
There are several repositories and databases that have been created for both sORFs and micropeptides. A repository for of small ORFs discovered by ribosome profiling can be found at sORFs.org.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sorfs.org/|title=sORFs.org: repository of small ORFs identified by ribosome profiling|website=sorfs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olexiouk V, Crappé J, Verbruggen S, Verhegen K, Martens L, Menschaert G | title = sORFs.org: a repository of small ORFs identified by ribosome profiling | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = D1 | pages = D324–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26527729 | pmc = 4702841 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkv1175 }}</ref> A repository of putative sORF-encoded peptides in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' can be found at ARA-PEPs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/CSB/ARA-PEPs/|title=ARA-PEPs: A Repository of putative sORF-encoded peptides in ''Arabidopsis thaliana''|website=www.biw.kuleuven.be|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hazarika RR, De Coninck B, Yamamoto LR, Martin LR, Cammue BP, van Noort V | title = ARA-PEPs: a repository of putative sORF-encoded peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 37 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28095775 | pmc = 5240266 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-016-1458-y }}</ref> A database of small proteins, especially encoded by non-coding RNAs can be found at SmProt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bioinfo.ibp.ac.cn/SmProt/|title=SmProt: a database of small proteins encoded by annotated coding and non-coding RNA loci|website=bioinfo.ibp.ac.cn|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hao Y, Zhang L, Niu Y, Cai T, Luo J, He S, Zhang B, Zhang D, Qin Y, Yang F, Chen R | title = SmProt: a database of small proteins encoded by annotated coding and non-coding RNA loci | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 636–643 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 28137767 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbx005 }}</ref>

== Prokaryotic examples ==
To date, most micropeptides have been identified in [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms. While most have yet to be fully characterized, of those that have been studied, many appear to be critical to the survival of these organisms. Because of their small size, prokaryotes are particularly susceptible to changes in their environment, and as such have developed methods to ensure their existence.

=== ''Escherichia coli'' ''(E. coli)'' ===
Micropeptides expressed in ''E. coli'' exemplify bacterial environmental adaptations. Most of these have been classified into three groups: leader peptides, ribosomal proteins, and toxic proteins. Leader proteins regulate transcription and/or translation of proteins involved in amino acid metabolism when amino acids are scarce. Ribosomal proteins include L36 (''rpmJ'') and L34 (''rpmH''), two components of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Toxic proteins, such as ''ldrD'', are toxic at high levels and can kill cells or inhibit growth, which functions to reduce the host cell's viability.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemm MR, Paul BJ, Schneider TD, Storz G, Rudd KE | title = Small membrane proteins found by comparative genomics and ribosome binding site models | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 1487–501 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19121005 | pmc = 2614699 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06495.x }}</ref>

=== ''Salmonella enterica (S. enterica)'' ===
In ''S. enterica,'' the MgtC virulence factor is involved in adaptation to low magnesium environments. The hydrophobic peptide MgrR, binds to MgtC, causing its degradation by the FtsH protease.<ref name="":4"" />

=== ''Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis)'' ===
The 46 aa Sda micropeptide, expressed by ''B. subtilis'', represses sporulation when replication initiation is impaired. By inhibiting the histidine Kinase KinA, Sda prevents the activation of the transcription factor Spo0A, which is required for sporulation.<ref name="":5"" />

=== ''Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)'' ===
In ''S. aureus'', there are a group of micropeptides, 20-22 aa, that are excreted during host infection to disrupt neutrophil membranes, causing cell lysis. These micropeptides allow the bacterium to avoid degradation by the human immune systems' main defenses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang R, Braughton KR, Kretschmer D, Bach TH, Queck SY, Li M, Kennedy AD, Dorward DW, Klebanoff SJ, Peschel A, DeLeo FR, Otto M | title = Identification of novel cytolytic peptides as key virulence determinants for community-associated MRSA | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 1510–4 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17994102 | doi = 10.1038/nm1656 | s2cid = 8465052 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemm MR, Paul BJ, Miranda-Ríos J, Zhang A, Soltanzad N, Storz G | title = Small stress response proteins in Escherichia coli: proteins missed by classical proteomic studies | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 192 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–58 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19734316 | pmc = 2798279 | doi = 10.1128/jb.00872-09 }}</ref>

== Eukaryotic examples ==
Micropeptides have been discovered in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms from ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' to humans. They play diverse roles in tissue and organ development, as well as maintenance and function once fully developed. While many are yet to be functionally characterized, and likely more remain to be discovered, below is a summary of recently identified eukaryotic micropeptide functions.

=== ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' (''A. thaliana'') ===
The ''POLARIS (PLS)'' gene encodes a 36 aa micropeptide. It is necessary for proper vascular leaf patterning and cell expansion in the root.

The ''[[Elabela]]'' gene (''Ela)'' (a.k.a. Apela, Toddler) is important for embryogenesis.<ref name="":8"" /> It is specifically expressed during late blastula and gastrula stages. During [[gastrulation]], it is critical in promoting the internalization and animal-pole directed movement of mes[[endoderm]]al cells. After gastrulation, Ela is expressed in the lateral mesoderm, endoderm, as well as the anterior, and posterior, notochord. Although it was annotated as a [[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNA]] in zebrafish, mouse, and human, the 58-aa ORF was found to be highly conserved among vertebrate species. Ela is processed by removal of its N-terminus [[signal peptide]] and then [[secreted]] in the [[extracellular space]]. Its 34-aa mature peptide serves as the first endogenous [[ligand]] to a [[GPCR]] known as the [[APLNR (gene)|Apelin Receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauli A, Norris ML, Valen E, Chew GL, Gagnon JA, Zimmerman S, Mitchell A, Ma J, Dubrulle J, Reyon D, Tsai SQ, Joung JK, Saghatelian A, Schier AF | title = Toddler: an embryonic signal that promotes cell movement via Apelin receptors | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6172 | pages = 1248636 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24407481 | pmc = 4107353 | doi = 10.1126/science.1248636 }}</ref><ref name="":8"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chng SC, Ho L, Tian J, Reversade B | title = ELABELA: a hormone essential for heart development signals via the apelin receptor | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–80 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24316148 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.002 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The genetic inactivation of Ela or Aplnr in [[zebrafish]] results in heartless phenotypes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Deshwar|first1=Ashish R|last2=Chng|first2=Serene C|last3=Ho|first3=Lena|last4=Reversade|first4=Bruno|last5=Scott|first5=Ian C|date=2016-04-14|editor-last=Robertson|editor-first=Elizabeth|title=The Apelin receptor enhances Nodal/TGFβ signaling to ensure proper cardiac development|url= |journal=eLife|volume=5|pages=e13758|doi=10.7554/eLife.13758|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4859801|pmid=27077952}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Ian C.|last2=Masri|first2=Bernard|last3=D'Amico|first3=Leonard A.|last4=Jin|first4=Suk-Won|last5=Jungblut|first5=Benno|last6=Wehman|first6=Ann M.|last7=Baier|first7=Herwig|last8=Audigier|first8=Yves|last9=Stainier|first9=Didier Y.

=== ''Mus musculus'' (''M. musculus'') ===
[[Myoregulin]] (Mln) is encoded by a gene originally annotated as a lncRNA. Mln is expressed in all 3 types of skeletal muscle, and works similarly to the micropeptides [[phospholamban]] (Pln) in the cardiac muscle and [[sarcolipin]] (Sln) in slow (Type I) skeletal muscle. These micropeptides interact with [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase|sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase]] (SERCA), a membrane pump responsible for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR). By inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the SR, they cause muscle relaxation. Similarly, the [[endoregulin]] (ELN) and [[another-regulin]] (ALN) genes code for transmembrane micropeptides that contain the SERCA binding motif, and are conserved in mammals.<ref name="":2"" />

[[Myomixer]] (Mymx) is encoded by the gene ''Gm7325,'' a muscle-specific peptide, 84 aa in length, which plays a role during embryogenesis in fusion and skeletal muscle formation. It localizes to the plasma membrane, associating with a fusogenic membrane protein, [[Myomaker]] (Mymk). In humans, the gene encoding Mymx is annotated as uncharacterized ''LOC101929726''.

The 24 amino acid micropeptide, [[Humanin]] (HN), interacts with the apoptosis-inducing protein [[Bcl-2-associated X protein|Bcl2-associated X protein]] (Bax). In its active state, Bax undergoes a conformational change which exposes membrane-targeting domains. This causes it to move from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, where it inserts and releases apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c. By interacting with Bax, HN prevents Bax targeting of the mitochondria, thereby blocking apoptosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo B, Zhai D, Cabezas E, Welsh K, Nouraini S, Satterthwait AC, Reed JC | title = Humanin peptide suppresses apoptosis by interfering with Bax activation | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6938 | pages = 456–61 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12732850 | doi = 10.1038/nature01627 | bibcode = 2003Natur.423..456G | s2cid = 4423176 }}</ref>

'''Induced stem cells''' ('''iSC''') are [[stem cells]] derived from [[Somatic cell|somatic]], [[Reproductive cells|reproductive]], [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] or other cell types by deliberate [[epigenetic]] reprogramming. They are classified as either [[totipotency|totipotent]] (iTC), [[Induced pluripotent stem cells|pluripotent]] (iPSC) or [[Progenitor cells|progenitor]] (multipotent – iMSC, also called an induced multipotent progenitor cell – iMPC) or [[Unipotency|unipotent]] – (iUSC) according to their [[Cell potency|developmental potential and degree of dedifferentiation]]. Progenitors are obtained by so-called [[#Induced progenitor stem cells|direct reprogramming]] or directed [[Transdifferentiation|differentiation]] and are also called induced [[Adult stem cell|somatic stem cells]].

In 1895 [[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Thomas Morgan]] removed one of a [[frog]]'s two [[blastomere]]s and found that [[amphibians]] are able to form whole [[embryo]]s from the remaining part. This meant that the cells can change their differentiation pathway.

One example is the transformation of [[iris (eye)|iris]] cells to [[lens (eye)|lens]] cells in the process of maturation and transformation of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] cells into the neural retina during regeneration in adult [[newt]] eyes. This process allows the body to replace cells not suitable to new conditions with more suitable new cells. In [[Drosophila]] imaginal discs, cells have to choose from a limited number of standard discrete differentiation states. The fact that transdetermination (change of the path of differentiation) often occurs for a group of cells rather than single cells shows that it is induced rather than part of maturation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei G, Schubiger G, Harder F, Müller AM | title = Stem cell plasticity in mammals and transdetermination in Drosophila: common themes? | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 409–14 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11072028 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.18-6-409 | doi-access = free }}<br />{{cite journal | vauthors = Worley MI, Setiawan L, Hariharan IK | title = Regeneration and transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 46 | pages = 289–310 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22934642 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155637 }}</ref>

The researchers were able to identify the minimal conditions and factors that would be sufficient for starting the cascade of molecular and cellular processes to instruct pluripotent cells to organize the [[embryo]].

Some types of mature, specialized adult cells can naturally revert to stem cells. For example, ""chief"" cells express the stem cell marker Troy. While they normally produce digestive fluids for the stomach, they can revert into stem cells to make temporary repairs to stomach injuries, such as a cut or damage from infection.

In August 2006, Japanese researchers circumvented the need for an oocyte, as in SCNT. By reprograming mouse embryonic [[fibroblast]]s into pluripotent stem cells via the ectopic expression of four [[transcription factor]]s, namely [[Oct4]], [[Sox2]], [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]], they proved that the overexpression of a small number of factors can push the cell to transition to a new stable state that is associated with changes in the activity of thousands of genes.<ref name=""Takahashi""/>

A small molecule called MitoBloCK-6 can force the pluripotent stem cells to die by triggering [[apoptosis]] (via [[cytochrome c]] release across the [[mitochondria]]l outer membrane) in human pluripotent stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. Shortly after differentiation, daughter cells became resistant to death. When MitoBloCK-6 was introduced to differentiated cell lines, the cells remained healthy. The key to their survival was hypothesized to be due to the changes undergone by pluripotent stem cell mitochondria in the process of cell differentiation. This ability of MitoBloCK-6 to separate the pluripotent and differentiated cell lines has the potential to reduce the risk of teratomas and other problems in regenerative medicine.<ref name=""Dabir"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabir DV, Hasson SA, Setoguchi K, Johnson ME, Wongkongkathep P, Douglas CJ, Zimmerman J, Damoiseaux R, Teitell MA, Koehler CM | display-authors = 6 | title = A small molecule inhibitor of redox-regulated protein translocation into mitochondria | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–92 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23597483 | pmc = 3726224 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2013.03.006 }}</ref>

=== Chemical inducement ===

By using solely [[small molecules]], Deng Hongkui and colleagues demonstrated that endogenous ""master genes"" are enough for cell fate reprogramming. They induced a pluripotent state in adult cells from mice using seven small-molecule compounds.<ref name=""Hongkui Deng""/>
The method's effectiveness is quite high: it was able to convert 0.02% of the adult tissue cells into iPSCs, which is comparable to the gene insertion conversion rate.
The authors note that the mice generated from CiPSCs were ""100% viable and apparently healthy for up to 6 months"". So, this chemical reprogramming strategy has potential use in generating functional desirable cell types for clinical applications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = De Los Angeles A, Daley GQ | title = A chemical logic for reprogramming to pluripotency | journal = Cell Research | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 1337–8 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23979017 | pmc = 3847567 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2013.119 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Federation AJ, Bradner JE, Meissner A | title = The use of small molecules in somatic-cell reprogramming | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 179–87 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24183602 | pmc = 3943685 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2013.09.011 }}</ref>

=== Differentiation from induced teratoma ===

The fact that human iPSCs are capable of forming teratomas not only in humans but also in some animal body, in particular mice or pigs, allowed researchers to develop a method for differentiation of iPSCs in vivo. For this purpose, iPSCs with an agent for inducing differentiation into target cells are injected to a [[Genetically modified mammal|genetically modified]] pig or mouse that has suppressed immune system activation on human cells.
The formed teratoma is cut out and used for the isolation of the necessary differentiated human cells<ref>{{cite patent | country = WO | number = 2011071085 | inventor = Hiromitsu N, Akihide K, Nao S, Keiichi I, Satoshi Y | assign1 = University of Tokyo | title = Method for Producing Cells Induced to Differentiate from Pluripotent Stem Cells | pubdate = 2011-06-16 }}</ref> by means of [[monoclonal antibody]] to tissue-specific markers on the surface of these cells. This method has been successfully used for the production of functional myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid human cells suitable for transplantation (yet only to mice).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amabile G, Welner RS, Nombela-Arrieta C, D'Alise AM, Di Ruscio A, Ebralidze AK, Kraytsberg Y, Ye M, Kocher O, Neuberg DS, Khrapko K, Silberstein LE, Tenen DG | display-authors = 6 | title = In vivo generation of transplantable human hematopoietic cells from induced pluripotent stem cells | journal = Blood | volume = 121 | issue = 8 | pages = 1255–64 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23212524 | pmc = 3701251 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2012-06-434407 }}</ref>
Mice engrafted with human iPSC teratoma-derived hematopoietic cells produced human B and T cells capable of functional immune responses. These results offer hope that in vivo generation of patient customized cells is feasible, providing materials that could be useful for transplantation, human antibody generation, and drug screening applications.
Using MitoBloCK-6<ref name=""Dabir""/> and/or PluriSIn # 1 the differentiated progenitor cells can be further purified from teratoma forming pluripotent cells. The fact that the differentiation takes place even in the teratoma niche offers hope that the resulting cells are sufficiently stable to stimuli able to cause their transition back to the dedifferentiated (pluripotent) state and therefore safe. A similar in vivo differentiation system, yielding engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from mouse and human iPSCs in teratoma-bearing animals in combination with a maneuver to facilitate hematopoiesis, was described by Suzuki et al.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuki N, Yamazaki S, Yamaguchi T, Okabe M, Masaki H, Takaki S, Otsu M, Nakauchi H | display-authors = 6 | title = Generation of engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from induced pluripotent stem cells by way of teratoma formation | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 1424–31 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23670574 | pmc = 3705943 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2013.71 }}</ref> They noted that neither leukemia nor tumors were observed in recipients after intravenous injection of iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem cells into irradiated recipients.

For further development of this method, animals (such as a mice) in which the human cell graft is grown must have modified genome such that all its cells express and have on its surface human [[Signal-regulatory protein alpha|SIRPα]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamauchi T, Takenaka K, Urata S, Shima T, Kikushige Y, Tokuyama T, Iwamoto C, Nishihara M, Iwasaki H, Miyamoto T, Honma N, Nakao M, Matozaki T, Akashi K | display-authors = 6 | title = Polymorphic Sirpa is the genetic determinant for NOD-based mouse lines to achieve efficient human cell engraftment | journal = Blood | volume = 121 | issue = 8 | pages = 1316–25 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23293079 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2012-06-440354 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
To prevent rejection after transplantation to the patient of the allogenic organ or tissue, grown from the pluripotent stem cells in vivo in the animal, these cells should express two molecules: [[Belatacept|CTLA4-Ig]], which disrupts T cell costimulatory pathways and [[PD-L1]], which activates T cell inhibitory pathway.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rong Z, Wang M, Hu Z, Stradner M, Zhu S, Kong H, Yi H, Goldrath A, Yang YG, Xu Y, Fu X | display-authors = 6 | title = An effective approach to prevent immune rejection of human ESC-derived allografts | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–30 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24388175 | pmc = 4023958 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.014 }}</ref>

An alternative approach is so-called ""direct reprogramming"" – transdifferentiation of cells without passing through the pluripotent state.<ref name=""Li"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian L, Huang

==== Single transcription factor transdifferentiation ====

Originally, only early embryonic cells could be coaxed into changing their identity. Mature cells are resistant to changing their identity once they've committed to a specific kind. However, brief expression of a single transcription factor, the ELT-7 GATA factor, can convert the identity of fully differentiated, specialized non-endodermal cells of the [[pharynx]] into fully differentiated intestinal cells in intact [[larvae]] and adult roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' with no requirement for a dedifferentiated intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riddle MR, Weintraub A, Nguyen KC, Hall DH, Rothman JH | title = Transdifferentiation and remodeling of post-embryonic C. elegans cells by a single transcription factor | journal = Development | volume = 140 | issue = 24 | pages = 4844–9 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24257624 | pmc = 3848185 | doi = 10.1242/dev.103010 }}</ref>

==== Transdifferentiation with CRISPR-mediated activator ====

The cell fate can be effectively manipulated by [[epigenome editing]], in particular via the direct activation of specific endogenous gene expression with [[CRISPR]]-mediated activator. When [[Cas9#Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning|dCas9]] (which has been modified so that it no longer cuts DNA, but still can be guided to specific sequences and to bind to them) is combined with transcription activators, it can precisely manipulate endogenous gene expression. Using this method, Wei et al., enhanced the expression of endogenous [[CDX2|Cdx2]] and [[GATA6|Gata6]] genes by CRISPR-mediated activators, thus directly converting mouse embryonic stem cells into two extraembryonic lineages, i.e., typical trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei S, Zou Q, Lai S, Zhang Q, Li L, Yan Q, Zhou X, Zhong H, Lai L | display-authors = 6 | title = Conversion of embryonic stem cells into extraembryonic lineages by CRISPR-mediated activators | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 19648 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26782778 | pmc = 4726097 | doi = 10.1038/srep19648 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...619648W }}</ref>  An analogous approach was used to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black JB, Adler AF, Wang HG, D'Ippolito AM, Hutchinson HA, Reddy TE, Pitt GS, Leong KW, Gersbach CA | display-authors = 6 | title = Targeted Epigenetic Remodeling of Endogenous Loci by CRISPR/Cas9-Based Transcriptional Activators Directly Converts Fibroblasts to Neuronal Cells | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 406–14 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27524438 | pmc = 5010447 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.001 }}</ref>  Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.

=== Phased process modeling regeneration ===

Another way of reprogramming is the simulation of processes that occur during [[amphibian]] limb regeneration. In [[urodele]] amphibians, an early step in limb regeneration is skeletal muscle fiber dedifferentiation into a cellulate that proliferates into limb tissue. However, sequential small molecule treatment of the muscle fiber with myoseverin, [[reversine]] (the [[aurora B kinase]] inhibitor), and some other chemicals (BIO (glycogen synthase-3 kinase inhibitor), [[lysophosphatidic acid]] (pleiotropic activator of G-protein-coupled receptors), [[SB203580]] ([[p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitor), or [[SQ22536]] (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor)) causes the formation of new muscle cell types as well as other cell types such as precursors to fat, bone, and nervous system cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung DW, Williams DR | title = Novel chemically defined approach to produce multipotent cells from terminally differentiated tissue syncytia | journal = ACS Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 553–62 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21322636 | doi = 10.1021/cb2000154 }}<br/>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cb300127f| title = In This Issue| journal = ACS Chemical Biology| volume = 7| issue = 4| pages = 619| year = 2012}}</ref>

=== Antibody-based transdifferentiation ===

The researchers discovered that [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|GCSF]]-mimicking [[antibody]] can activate a growth-stimulating receptor on [[Bone marrow|marrow]] cells in a way that induces marrow stem cells which normally develop into white blood cells to become neural progenitor cells.

ME-CRCs isolated from MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+, and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME-CRCs from MMTV-Neu tumors that were implanted in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable from that of the parental tumors that develop in the MMTV-Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and for in vivo transplant studies.

A different approach to CRC is to inhibit [[CD47]] – a [[membrane protein]] that is the [[thrombospondin-1]] receptor. Loss of CD47 permits sustained proliferation of primary [[murine]] endothelial cells, increases asymmetric division, and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent [[embryoid body]]-like clusters. CD47 knockdown acutely increases [[mRNA]] levels of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors in cells in vitro and in vivo. Thrombospondin-1 is a key environmental signal that inhibits stem cell self-renewal via CD47. Thus, CD47 antagonists enable cell self-renewal and reprogramming by overcoming negative regulation of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaur S, Soto-Pantoja DR, Stein EV, Liu C, Elkahloun AG, Pendrak ML, Nicolae A, Singh SP, Nie Z, Levens D, Isenberg JS, Roberts DD | display-authors = 6 | title = Thrombospondin-1 signaling through CD47 inhibits self-renewal by regulating c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | pages = 1673 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23591719 | pmc = 3628113 | doi = 10.1038/srep01673 | bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1673K }}</ref> In vivo blockade of CD47 using an antisense [[morpholino]] increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation due to increased proliferative capacity of bone marrow-derived cells and radioprotection of radiosensitive gastrointestinal tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soto-Pantoja DR, Ridnour LA, Wink DA, Roberts DD | title = Blockade of CD47 increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | pages = 1038 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23301159 | pmc = 3539147 | doi = 10.1038/srep01038 | bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1038S }}</ref>

==== Lineage-specific enhancers ====
Differentiated [[macrophages]] can self-renew in tissues and expand long-term in culture.<ref name=""Maf""/> Under certain conditions, macrophages can divide without losing features they have acquired while specializing into [[immune cells]] – which is usually not possible with [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]]. The macrophages achieve this by activating a [[Gene regulatory network|gene network]] similar to one found in embryonic stem cells. [[Single-cell analysis]] revealed that, ''in vivo'', proliferating macrophages can derepress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self-renewal. This happened when concentrations of two transcription factors named [[MAFB (gene)|MafB]] and [[MAF (gene)|c-Maf]] were naturally low or were inhibited for a short time. Genetic manipulations that turned off MafB and c-Maf in the macrophages caused the cells to start a self-renewal program. The similar network also controls embryonic stem cell self-renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers.<ref name=""Maflin""/>

Hence macrophages isolated from MafB- and c-Maf-double deficient mice divide indefinitely; the self-renewal depends on [[Myc|c-Myc]] and [[KLF4|Klf4]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gentek R, Molawi K, Sieweke MH | title = Tissue macrophage identity and self-renewal | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 262 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–73 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25319327 | doi = 10.1111/imr.12224 | s2cid = 20849255 }}</ref>

=== Indirect lineage conversion ===

Indirect lineage conversion is a reprogramming methodology in which somatic cells transition through a plastic intermediate state of partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSC), induced by brief exposure to reprogramming factors, followed by differentiation in a specially developed chemical environment (artificial niche).<ref name=""Kurian"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurian L, Sancho-Martinez I, Nivet E, Aguirre A, Moon K, Pendaries C, Volle-Challier C, Bono F, Herbert JM, Pulecio J, Xia Y, Li M, Montserrat N, Ruiz S, Dubova I, Rodriguez C, Denli AM, Boscolo FS, Thiagarajan RD, Gage FH, Loring JF, Laurent LC, Izpisua Belmonte JC | display-authors = 6 | title = Conversion of human fibroblasts to angioblast-like progenitor cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–83 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23202434 | pmc = 3531579 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2255 | first5 = Carlos }}</ref>

This method could be both more efficient and safer, since it does not seem to produce tumors or other undesirable genetic changes and results in much greater yield than other methods. However, the safety of these cells remains questionable. Since lineage conversion from pre-iPSC relies on the use of iPSC reprogramming conditions, a fraction of the cells could acquire pluripotent properties if they do not stop the de-differentation process in vitro or due to further de-differentiation in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris SA, Daley GQ | title = A blueprint for engineering cell fate: current technologies to reprogram cell identity | journal = Cell Research | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–48 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23277278 | pmc = 3541663 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2013.1 }}</ref>

Physical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells' epigenetic state. Specifically, ""decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) – a subunit of H3 methyltranferase – by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation"".

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergo self-renewal in the presence of the [[cytokine]] [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF). Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, accompanied by an increase in cell–substratum [[adhesion]] and cell spreading. Restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biosubstrates, or by manipulating the [[cytoskeleton]], allowed the cells to remain in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state.

=== Oligodendrocyte precursor cells ===

Without [[myelin]] to insulate neurons, nerve signals quickly lose power. Diseases that attack myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, result in nerve signals that cannot propagate to nerve endings and as a consequence lead to cognitive, motor and sensory problems. Transplantation of [[oligodendrocyte]] precursor cells (OPCs), which can successfully create myelin sheaths around nerve cells, is a promising potential therapeutic response. Direct lineage conversion of mouse and rat fibroblasts into oligodendroglial cells provides a potential source of OPCs.

=== Blood vessel cells ===

As blood vessels age, they often become abnormal in structure and function, thereby contributing to numerous age-associated diseases including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis of arteries supplying the heart, brain and lower extremities. So, an important goal is to stimulate vascular growth for the [[collateral circulation]] to prevent the exacerbation of these diseases. Induced Vascular Progenitor Cells (iVPCs) are useful for cell-based therapy designed to stimulate coronary collateral growth. They were generated by partially reprogramming endothelial cells.<ref name=""Kurian"" /> The vascular commitment of iVPCs is related to the epigenetic memory of endothelial cells, which engenders them as cellular components of growing blood vessels. That is why, when iVPCs were implanted into [[myocardium]], they engrafted in blood vessels and increased coronary collateral flow better than iPSCs, mesenchymal stem cells, or native endothelial cells.<ref name=""Chilian"">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin L, Ohanyan V, Pung YF, Delucia A, Bailey E, Enrick M, Stevanov K, Kolz CL, Guarini G, Chilian WM | display-authors = 6 | title = Induction of vascular progenitor cells from endothelial cells stimulates coronary collateral growth | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–52 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22095729 | pmc = 3974272 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.250126 }}</ref>

To treat infarction, it is important to prevent the formation of fibrotic scar tissue.

=== Thymic epithelial cells rejuvenation ===
The [[thymus]] is the first organ to deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the immune system becomes less effective with age. Diminished expression of the [[thymic epithelial cell]] transcription factor [[FOXN1]] has been implicated as a component of the mechanism regulating age-related involution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo J, Feng Y, Barnes P, Huang FF, Idell S, Su DM, Shams H | title = Deletion of FoxN1 in the thymic medullary epithelium reduces peripheral T cell responses to infection and mimics changes of aging | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e34681 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22514652 | pmc = 3326029 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0034681 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...734681G | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun L, Guo J, Brown R, Amagai T, Zhao Y, Su DM | title = Declining expression of a single epithelial cell-autonomous gene accelerates age-related thymic involution | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–57 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20156205 | pmc = 2894280 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00559.x }}</ref>

[[Clare Blackburn]] and colleagues show that established age-related thymic involution can be reversed by forced upregulation of just one transcription factor – FOXN1 in the thymic epithelial cells in order to promote [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], proliferation and differentiation of these cells into fully functional thymic epithelium.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bredenkamp N, Nowell CS, Blackburn CC | title = Regeneration of the aged thymus by a single transcription factor | journal = Development | volume = 141 | issue = 8 | pages = 1627–37 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24715454 | pmc = 3978836 | doi = 10.1242/dev.103614 }}</ref>
This rejuvenation and increased proliferation was accompanied by upregulation of genes that promote [[cell cycle]] progression ([[cyclin D1]], ΔN[[TP63|p63]], [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2#Isoforms|FgfR2IIIb]]) and that are required in the thymic epithelial cells to promote specific aspects of [[T cell]] development ([[DLL4|Dll4]], [[Stem cell factor|Kit]]l, [[CCL25|Ccl25]], [[Stromal cell-derived factor 1|Cxcl12]], [[CD40 (protein)|Cd40]], [[CD80|Cd80]], [[Cathepsin L1|Ctsl]], [[PAX1|Pax1]]).

This epigenetic memory does not necessarily manifest itself at the pluripotency stage – iPSCs derived from different tissues exhibit proper morphology, express pluripotency markers and are able to differentiate into the three embryonic layers in vitro and in vivo. However, this epigenetic memory may manifest during re-differentiation into specific cell types that require the specific loci bearing residual epigenetic marks.

== Overview ==
[[Epilepsy]] refers to a group of chronic [[neurological disorder]]s that are characterized by [[seizures]], affecting over 50 million people, or 0.4–1% of the global population.<ref name=r1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirose G | title = [An overview of epilepsy: its history, classification, pathophysiology and management] | journal = Brain and Nerve = Shinkei Kenkyu No Shinpo | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 509–20 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23667116 }}</ref><ref name=r2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sander JW, Shorvon SD | title = Epidemiology of the epilepsies | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–43 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8965090 | pmc = 1074036 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.61.5.433 }}</ref> There is a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy, especially of forms characterized by the onset of seizures from a specific area of the brain ([[Partial seizure|partial-onset epilepsy]]).

As a result, many people with epilepsy are left without any treatment options to consider, and thus there is a strong need for the development of innovative methods for treating epilepsy.{{cn|date=July 2021}}

Through the use of viral vector gene transfer, with the purpose of delivering DNA or RNA to the epileptogenic zone, several [[neuropeptide]]s, [[ion channel]]s and [[neurotransmitter receptor]]s have shown potential as [[transgene]]s for epilepsy treatment. Among vectors are [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] and [[Adeno-associated virus|adeno-associated virus vectors]] (AAV), which have the properties of high and efficient transduction, ease of production in high volumes, a wide range of hosts, and extended gene expression.<ref name=R5>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naegele JR, Maisano X, Yang J, Royston S, Ribeiro E | title = Recent advancements in stem cell and gene therapies for neurological disorders and intractable epilepsy | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–64 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20146928 | pmc = 2838966 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.01.019 }}</ref> [[Lentiviral vector in gene therapy|Lentiviral]] vectors have also shown promise.

==Clinical research==

Among challenges to clinical translation of gene therapy are possible immune responses to the viral vectors and transgenes and the possibility of [[insertional mutagenesis]], which can be detrimental to patient safety.<ref name=r6>{{cite book|last=Giacca|first=Mauro | name-list-style = vanc |title=Gene Therapy|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-88-470-1642-2|pages=284–86}}</ref> Scaling up from the volume needed for animal trials to that needed for effective human transfection is an area of difficulty, although it has been overcome in other diseases. With its size of less than 20&nbsp;nm, AAV in part addresses these problems, allowing for its passage through the extracellular space, leading to widespread transfection. Although lentivectors can integrate in the genome of the host this may not represent a risk for treatment of neurological diseases because adult neurons do not divide and so are less prone to insertional mutagenesis{{cn|date=July 2021}}

==Viral approaches in preclinical development==
In finding a method for treating epilepsy, the pathophysiology of epilepsy is considered. As the seizures that characterize epilepsy typically result from excessive and synchronous discharges of excitatory neurons, the logical goal for gene therapy treatment is to reduce excitation or enhance inhibition. Out of the viral approaches, neuropeptide transgenes being researched are somatostatin, galanin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, adenosine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA receptors are gaining more momentum as well. Other transgenes being studied are [[potassium channel]]s and tools for on-demand suppression of excitability ([[optogenetics]] and [[chemogenetics]]).{{cn|date=July 2021}}

===Adenosine===

[[Adenosine]] is an inhibitory nucleoside that doubles up as a [[neuromodulator]], aiding in the modulation of brain function. It has anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to neuroprotective and anti-epileptic properties.<ref name=r4/> The most prevalent theory is that upon brain injury there is an increased expression of the [[adenosine kinase]] (ADK). The increase in adenosine kinase results in an increased metabolic rate for adenosine nucleosides. Due to the decrease in these nucleosides that possess anti-epileptic properties and the overexpression of the ADK, seizures are triggered, potentially resulting in the development of [[epileptogenesis]].<ref name=R5 />  Studies have shown that ADK overexpression results from [[astrogliosis]] following a brain injury, which can lead to the development of epileptogenesis. While ADK overexpression leads to increased susceptibility to seizures, the effects can be counteracted and moderated by adenosine.<ref name=r14>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boison D | title = Adenosine kinase, epilepsy and stroke: mechanisms and therapies | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 652–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17056128 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2006.10.008 }}</ref> Based on the properties afforded by adenosine in preventing seizures, in addition to its FDA approval in the treatment of other ailments such as [[tachycardia]] and chronic pain, adenosine is an ideal target for the development of anti-epileptic gene therapies.<ref name=r15>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boison D, Stewart KA | title = Therapeutic epilepsy research: from pharmacological rationale to focal adenosine augmentation | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 78 | issue = 12 | pages = 1428–37 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19682439 | pmc = 2766433 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.08.005 }}</ref>

===Galanin===
[[Galanin]], found primarily within the [[central nervous system]] (limbic system, piriform cortex, and amygdala), plays a role in the reduction of [[long term potentiation]] (LTP), regulating consumption habits, as well as inhibiting seizure activity.<ref name=r10 /> Introduced back in the 1990s by Mazarati et al., galanin has been shown to have [[neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] and inhibitory properties. Through the use of mice that are deficient in GalR1 receptors, a [[kindling model|picrotoxin-kindled model]] was utilized to show that galanin plays a role in modulating and preventing hilar cell loss as well as decreasing the duration of induced seizures.<ref name=r9>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazarati AM, Halászi E, Telegdy G | title = Anticonvulsive effects of galanin administered into the central nervous system upon the picrotoxin-kindled seizure syndrome in rats | journal = Brain Research | volume = 589 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–6 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1384926 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(92)91179-i | s2cid = 39796913 }}</ref> Conducted studies confirm these findings of preventing hilar hair cell loss, decreasing the number and duration of induced seizures, increasing the stimulation threshold required to induce seizures, and suppressing the release of glutamate that would increase susceptibility to seizure activity.<ref name=r4 /><ref name=r10>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCown TJ | title = Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression and constitutive secretion of galanin suppresses limbic seizure activity in vivo | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–8 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16730475 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.04.004 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=r11>{{cite journal | vauthors = Löscher W, Gernert M, Heinemann U | s2cid = 33488218 | title = Cell and gene therapies in epilepsy--promising avenues or blind alleys? | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 62–73 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18201772 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2007.11.012 }}</ref> Galanin expression can be utilized to significantly moderate and reduce seizure activity and limit seizure cell death.<ref name=r10 />

===Neuropeptide Y===
[[Neuropeptide Y]] (NPY), which is found in the [[autonomic nervous system]], helps modulate the hypothalamus, and therefore, consumption habits.<ref name=r4 /> Experiments have been conducted to determine the effect of NPY on animal models before and after induced seizures.<ref name=r4 /><ref name=r8 /> To evaluate the effect prior to seizures, one study inserted vectors 8 weeks prior to [[kindling model|kindling]], showing an increase in seizure threshold. In order to evaluate the effects after [[epileptogenesis]] was present, the vectors were injected into the hippocampus of rats after seizures were induced. This resulted in a reduction of seizure activity. These studies established that NPY increased the seizure threshold in rats, arrested disease progression, and reduced seizure duration.<ref name=r4 /><ref name=r8 /> After examining the effects of NPY on behavioral and physiological responses, it was discovered that it had no effect on LTP, learning, or memory.<ref name=r8 /> A protocol for NPY gene transfer is being reviewed by the FDA.<ref name=r11 />

===Somatostatin===
[[Somatostatin]] is a neuropeptide and [[neuromodulator]] that plays a role in the regulation of hormones as well as aids in sleep and motor activity. It is primarily found in interneurons that modulates the firing rates of pyramidal cells primarily at a local level. They [[feedforward neural network|feed-forward]] inhibit pyramidal cells. In a series of studies where somatostatin was expressed in a [[kindling model|rodent kindling model]], it was concluded that somatostatin resulted in a decreased average duration for seizures, increasing its potential as an anti-seizure drug.<ref name=R7>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zafar R, King MA, Carney PR | s2cid = 34166460 | title = Adeno associated viral vector-mediated expression of somatostatin in rat hippocampus suppresses seizure development | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 509 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–91 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22245439 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2011.12.035 }}</ref> The theory in utilizing somatostatin is that if pyramidal cells are eliminated, then the feed forward, otherwise known as inhibition, is lost. Somatostatin containing interneurons carry the neurotransmitter GABA, which primarily hyperpolarizes the cells, which is where the feed forward theory is derived from. The hope of gene therapy is that by overexpressing somatostatin in specific cells, and increasing the GABAergic tone, it is possible to restore balance between inhibition and excitation.<ref name=r4 /><ref name=r8>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonato M | s2cid = 18881057 | title = Gene therapy for epilepsy | journal = Epilepsy & Behavior | volume = 38 | pages = 125–30 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24100249 | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.09.013 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/896279 }}</ref>

===Potassium channels===
[[Kv1.1]] is a voltage-gated potassium channel encoded by the [[KCNA1]] gene. It is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral nerves, and plays a role in controlling the excitability of neurons and the amount of neurotransmitter released from axon terminals. Successful gene therapy using [[Lentivirus|lentiviral]] delivery of [[KCNA1]] has been reported in a rodent model of [[Epilepsia partialis continua|focal motor cortex epilepsy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wykes RC, Heeroma JH, Mantoan L, Zheng K, MacDonald DC, Deisseroth K, Hashemi KS, Walker MC, Schorge S, Kullmann DM | display-authors = 6 | title = Optogenetic and potassium channel gene therapy in a rodent model of focal neocortical epilepsy | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 161 | pages = 161ra152 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23147003 | pmc = 3605784 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004190 }}</ref> The treatment was well tolerated, with no detectable effect on sensorimotor coordination. Gene therapy with a modified potassium channel delivered using either a non-integrating [[Lentivirus|lentivector]] that avoids the risk of [[insertional mutagenesis]] or an [[Adeno-associated virus|AAV]] has also been shown to be effective in other models of epilepsy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Snowball A, Chabrol E, Wykes RC, Shekh-Ahmad T, Cornford JH, Lieb A, Hughes MP, Massaro G, Rahim AA, Hashemi KS, Kullmann DM, Walker MC, Schorge S | display-authors = 6 | title = Epilepsy Gene Therapy Using an Engineered Potassium Channel | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 39 | issue = 16 | pages = 3159–3169 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30755487 | pmc = 6468110 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1143-18.2019 }}</ref>

===Optogenetics===
A potential obstacle to clinical translation of gene therapy is that viral vector-mediated manipulation of the genetic make-up of neurons is irreversible. An alternative approach is to use tools for on-demand suppression of neuronal and circuit excitability. The first such approach was to use [[optogenetics]]. Several laboratories have shown that the inhibitory light-sensitive protein [[Halorhodopsin]] can suppress seizure-like discharges in vitro as well as epileptic activity in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tønnesen J, Sørensen AT, Deisseroth K, Lundberg C, Kokaia M | title = Optogenetic control of epileptiform activity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 29 | pages = 12162–7 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19581573 | pmc = 2715517 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0901915106 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10612162T | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wykes RC, Heeroma JH, Mantoan L, Zheng K, MacDonald DC, Deisseroth K, Hashemi KS, Walker MC, Schorge S, Kullmann DM | display-authors = 6 | title = Optogenetic and potassium channel gene therapy in a rodent model of focal neocortical epilepsy | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 161 | pages = 161ra152 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23147003 | pmc = 3605784 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004190 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1369973/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krook-Magnuson E, Armstrong C, Oijala M, Soltesz I | title = On-demand optogenetic control of spontaneous seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | pages = 1376 | date = 2013-01-01 | pmid = 23340416 | pmc = 3562457 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2376 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.1376K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paz JT, Davidson TJ, Frechette ES, Delord B, Parada I, Peng K, Deisseroth K, Huguenard JR | display-authors = 6 | title = Closed-loop optogenetic control of thalamus as a tool for interrupting seizures after cortical injury | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–70 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23143518 | pmc = 3700812 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3269 }}</ref> A draw-back of optogenetics is that light needs to be delivered to the area of the brain expressing the [[opsin]]. This can be achieved with laser-coupled fiber-optics or light-emitting diodes, but these are invasive.{{cn|date=July 2021}}

===Chemogenetics===
An alternative approach for on-demand control of circuit excitability that does not require light delivery to the brain is to use [[chemogenetics]]. This relies on expressing a mutated [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the seizure focus, which does not respond to endogenous [[neurotransmitter]]s but can be activated by an exogenous drug. [[G protein–coupled receptor|G-protein coupled]] receptors mutated in this way are called [[DREADD|Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)]]. Success in treating epilepsy has been reported using the inhibitory DREADD hM4D(Gi), which is derived from the [[Muscarinic receptor|M4 muscarinic]] receptor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kätzel D, Nicholson E, Schorge S, Walker MC, Kullmann DM | title = Chemical-genetic attenuation of focal neocortical seizures | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 3847 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24866701 | pmc = 4050272 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms4847 | bibcode = 2014NatCo...5.3847K }}</ref> AAV-mediated expression of hM4D(Gi) in a rodent model of focal epilepsy on its own had no effect, but when activated by the drug [[clozapine N-oxide]] it suppressed seizures.

A mouse model of [[Dravet syndrome]] has been treated using a variant of [[CRISPR]] that relies on a [[guide RNA]] and a dead [[Cas9]] ([[dCas9]]) protein to recruit [[transcription (biology)|transcriptional]] activators to the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the [[sodium channel]] gene Scn1a in [[interneurons]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colasante G, Lignani G, Brusco S, Di Berardino C, Carpenter J, Giannelli S, Valassina N, Bido S, Ricci R, Castoldi V, Marenna S, Church T, Massimino L, Morabito G, Benfenati F, Schorge S, Leocani L, Kullmann DM, Broccoli V | display-authors = 6 | title = dCas9-Based Scn1a Gene Activation Restores Inhibitory Interneuron Excitability and Attenuates Seizures in Dravet Syndrome Mice | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 235–253 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31607539 | pmc = 6952031 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.08.018 }}</ref>

==Non-viral approaches==
[[Magnetofection]] is done through the use of super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with [[polyethylenimine]]. [[Iron oxide nanoparticles]] are ideal for biomedical applications in the body due to their biodegradable, cationic, non-toxic, and FDA-approved nature. Under gene transfer conditions, the receptors of interest are coated with the nanoparticles. The receptors will then home in and travel to the target of interest. Once the particle docks, the DNA is delivered to the cell via [[pinocytosis]] or [[endocytosis]]. Upon delivery, the temperature is increased ever so slightly, lysing the iron oxide nanoparticle and releasing the DNA. Overall, the technique is useful for combatting slow vector accumulation and low vector concentration at target areas. The technique is also customizable to the physical and biochemical properties of the receptors by modifying the characteristics of the iron oxide nanoparticles.<ref name=r12>{{cite journal| vauthors = Arsianti M, Lim M, Khatri A, Russell P, Amal R |title=Promise of Novel Magnetic Nanoparticles for Gene Therapy Application: Synthesis, Stabilisation, and Gene Delivery|journal=Chemeca 2008: Towards a Sustainable Australasia|year=2008|pages=734}}</ref><ref name=r13>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scherer F, Anton M, Schillinger U, Henke J, Bergemann C, Krüger A, Gänsbacher B, Plank C | display-authors = 6 | title = Magnetofection: enhancing and targeting gene delivery by magnetic force in vitro and in vivo | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–9 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11857068 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3301624 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Future implications==
The use of gene therapy in treating neurological disorders such as epilepsy has presented itself as an increasingly viable area of ongoing research with the primary targets being [[somatostatin]], [[galanin]], [[neuropeptide y]], [[potassium channel]]s, [[optogenetics]] and [[chemogenetics]] for epilepsy. As the field of gene therapy continues to grow and show promising results for the treatment of epilepsy among other diseases, additional research needs to be done in ensuring patient safety, developing alternative methods for DNA delivery, and finding feasible methods for scaling up delivery volumes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krook-Magnuson E, Soltesz I | title = Beyond the hammer and the scalpel: selective circuit control for the epilepsies | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–8 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25710834 | pmc = 4340083 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3943 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kullmann DM, Schorge S, Walker MC, Wykes RC | s2cid = 16544426 | title = Gene therapy in epilepsy-is it time for clinical trials? | journal = Nature Reviews.
