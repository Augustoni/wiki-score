The '''effects of climate change''' span the impacts on [[physical environment]], [[ecosystems]] and human societies due to ongoing human-caused [[climate change]]. The future impact of climate change depends on how much nations reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapt]] to climate change.<ref name=""adaptation and mitigation"">Oppenheimer, M., ''et al.'', ''Section 19.7.1: Relationship between Adaptation Efforts, Mitigation Efforts, and Residual Impacts,'' in: [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf Chapter 19: Emergent risks and key vulnerabilities] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20141020014746/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf 20 October 2014]), pp.1080–1085, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}

In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the [[tropics]]. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing [[Ocean current|currents in the oceans]].

Physical changes include [[extreme weather]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], sea level rise, [[Arctic sea ice decline|declines in Arctic sea ice]], and changes in the timing of seasonal events (such as earlier spring flowering). Since 1970, the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the [[ocean heat content|excess heat]] in the climate system. Even if global surface temperature is stabilized, sea levels will continue to rise and the ocean will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere for many centuries.<ref name=""ReferenceA"" /> The uptake of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]] is leading to [[ocean acidification]].<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite book|title=IPCC SROCC Summary for Policymakers|year=2019|page=9}}</ref>

[[Food security]] and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures. Climate change has profound impacts on human health, directly via heat stress and indirectly via the spread of infectious diseases. 

The vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries.

If emissions of {{CO2}} were to be abruptly stopped and no [[negative emission technologies]] deployed, the Earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state.

Mitigation policies currently in place will result in about 2.7&nbsp;°C (2.0–3.6&nbsp;°C, depending on how [[climate sensitivity|sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions]]) warming above pre-industrial levels. If all unconditional pledges and targets made by governments are achieved the temperature will rise by around 2.4&nbsp;°C. If  additionally all the countries that adopted or are considering to adopt net-zero targets will achieve it the temperature will rise by a median of 1.8&nbsp;°C. There is a substantial gap between national plans and commitments and actions so far taken by governments around the world.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126022845/https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/|archive-date=26 January 2022|date=9 November 2021|url=https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/|title= Temperatures|work=Climate Action Tracker}}</ref>

=== Precipitation (rainfall) ===
Warming by greenhouse gas forcing has increased contrasts in rainfall amounts between wet and dry seasons.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6, line 51}}</ref> This means colloquially: ""wet seasons are getting wetter, dry seasons are getting drier"". Warming has also resulted in a detectable increase in the precipitation of northern [[Polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]].<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"" />

Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation and surface drying. As the air warms, its water-holding capacity also increases, particularly over the oceans. Air holds 7% more [[water vapour]] for every degree Celsius it is warmed.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8_b2"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6,8–119}}</ref> Changes have already been observed in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation.

Global warming is expected to be accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some [[equatorial region]]s. In other words, regions which are dry at present will generally become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will generally become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, [[South Africa]], [[southern Australia]], the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]], and the [[Southwestern United States|south-western U.S.]]), a pattern that can be described as a poleward expansion of these semi-arid zones.<!-- This entire paragraph is based on the following reference --><ref name=""NOAA_GFDL_b"">

In the case of [[precipitation]], the rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's [[water cycle]], increasing evaporation. Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense downpours and cause extended droughts in certain regions. As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and an increased risk of flooding. In contrast, areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern [[latitudes]], and least warming over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=IPCC_synthesis_2007>

Global warming not only causes changes in tropical cyclones, it may also make some impacts from them worse via sea level rise. The intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) is projected to increase globally, with the proportion of [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category 4 and 5]] tropical cyclones increasing. Furthermore, the rate of rainfall is projected to increase, but trends in the future frequency on a global scale are not yet clear.<ref name=""christensen 2013 cyclones"">Christensen, J.H.,''et al.''

Even though weather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires, the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased globally. This is mostly the result of the conversion of [[savanna]] into [[croplands]], after which there is less forest area that can burn.

The reduced up and down mixing reduces the ability of the ocean to absorb heat, directing a larger fraction of future warming toward the atmosphere and land.

Warmer water cannot contain as much oxygen as cold water, changing the gas exchange equilibrium to reduce ocean oxygen levels and increase oxygen in the atmosphere.

=== Sea ice decline ===

{{Main|Arctic sea ice decline}}

Sea ice reflects 50% to 70% of the incoming solar radiation, while 6% of the incoming solar energy is reflected by the ocean. With less solar energy, the sea ice absorbs and holds the surface colder, which can be a positive feedback toward climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thermodynamics: Albedo {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021602/https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html|archive-date=11 October 2017|access-date=14 October 2020|website=nsidc.org}}</ref> As the climate warms, snow cover and sea ice extent decrease.

=== Water resources{{anchor|Water_resources}} ===
{{See also|Effects of climate change on the water cycle}}

[[Water resources]] can be affected by climate change in various ways. The total amount of [[freshwater]] available can change, for instance due to [[dry spell]]s or droughts. Heavy rainfall and flooding can have an impact on water quality: pollutants can be transported into water bodies by the increased [[surface runoff]]. In coastal regions, more salt may find its way into water resources due to higher sea levels and more intense storms. Higher temperatures also directly degrade water quality: warm water contains less oxygen.<ref name=""IPCC2022_FAQ4.1"">{{cite book |last1=Caretta |first1=Martina Angela |title=Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability |last2=Mukherji |first2=Aditi |publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] |series=Contribution of Working Group II to the [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report|Sixth Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |at=FAQ4.1 |chapter=Chapter 4: Water |display-authors=etal |chapter-url=https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter04.pdf}}</ref>

Economic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably. Researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the impact of potentially catastrophic climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages. Nevertheless, one 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2&nbsp;°C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kompas|first1=Tom|last2=Pham|first2=Van Ha|last3=Che|first3=Tuong Nhu|date=2018|title=The Effects of Climate Change on GDP by Country and the Global Economic Gains From Complying With the Paris Climate Accord|journal=Earth's Future|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1029/2018EF000922|issn=2328-4277|doi-access=free|bibcode=2018EaFut...6.1153K}}</ref>

==== Most affected sectors apart from agriculture and fisheries ====
[[Thermal power station]]s (fossil fuel plants and [[nuclear power plants]]) depend on water to cool them.

[[Insurance]] is an important tool to manage risks, but often unavailable to poorer households.

Roads, airport runways, railway lines and pipelines, (including [[oil pipeline]]s, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[water main]]s etc.) may require increased maintenance and renewal as they become subject to greater temperature variation.

=== Displacement and migration ===
{{Further|Climate migrant}}
Climate change affects displacement of people in several ways. Firstly, involuntary displacement may increase through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats. Effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. On the other hand, some households may fall (further) into poverty due to climate change, limiting their ability to move to areas less affected.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kaczan |first1=David J. |last2=Orgill-Meyer |first2=Jennifer |date=2020 |title=The impact of climate change on migration: a synthesis of recent empirical insights |journal=Climatic Change |language=en |volume=158 |issue=3 |pages=281–300 |doi=10.1007/s10584-019-02560-0 |bibcode=2020ClCh..158..281K |s2cid=207988694 |issn=1573-1480}}</ref>

Gradual but pervasive environmental change and sudden natural disasters both influence the nature and extent of human migration but in different ways. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] stated that climate change increases mass displacement, in many regions, including [[Sahel]], East Africa, South Asia, the ""drought corridor"" in Latin America. 90% of refugees comes from ""climate vulnerable hotspots"".<ref name=""UNHCR"">{{cite web |last1=Cheshirkov |first1=Boris |title=Climate change fuels violence and mass displacement in Cameroon |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107622 |access-date=12 December 2021 |website=United Nations}}</ref>

Governments have considered various approaches to reduce migration compelled by environmental conditions in at-risk communities, including programs of social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management.  Some experts support migration as an appropriate way for people to cope with environmental changes.  However, this is controversial because migrants – particularly low-skilled ones – are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<ref name=""beta.adb.org""/>

Climate change can worsen conflicts by exacerbating tensions over limited resources like [[drinking water]] (in the case of [[Water conflict|water conflicts]]). Climate change also has the potential to cause large population dislocations and migration, which can also lead to increased tensions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koubi |first1=Vally |year=2019 |title=Climate Change and Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=22 |pages=343–360 |doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070830 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burrows |first1=Kate |last2=Kinney |first2=Patrick L. |date=April 2016 |title=Exploring the Climate Change, Migration and Conflict Nexus |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |language=en |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=443 |doi=10.3390/ijerph13040443 |pmc=4847105 |pmid=27110806 |doi-access=free}}</ref> However, factors other than climate change are judged to be substantially more important in affecting conflict.

=== Social impacts on vulnerable groups ===
The impacts of climate change on humans are not distributed uniformly within communities. Individual and social factors such as gender, age, education, ethnicity, geography and language lead to differential [[vulnerability]] and capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. The following more vulnerable groups have been identified:

With [[population growth]] and increasing demand from higher standards of living, this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. Small islands, whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes, are already exposed to extreme weather events and changes in sea level. This existing exposure will likely make these areas sensitive to the effects of climate change.

[[Developed countries]] are also [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]], and have already been negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some [[extreme weather]] events, such as heat waves, floods, wildfires, and tropical cyclones.<ref name=""schneider regional vulnerabilities"">{{citation|author=Schneider, S.H.|title={{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-3.html Sec 19.3.3 Regional vulnerabilities]|chapter=Ch 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|display-authors=etal|access-date=28 December 2018|archive-date=23 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223030129/https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=BORENSTEIN |first1=SETH |last2=JORDANS |first2=FRANK |title=This summer's disasters show climate change is very much 'a rich-country problem' now |url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-04/summer-extremes-show-climate-change-rich-country-problem |access-date=9 August 2021 |agency=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Associated Press |date=4 August 2021 |archive-date=9 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809024412/https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-04/summer-extremes-show-climate-change-rich-country-problem |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=BORENSTEIN |first1=SETH |last2=JORDANS |first2=FRANK |title=This year's summer of climate extremes hits wealthier places |url=https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-science-climate-environment-and-nature-8752948ac9afcee5aec4811215dc7401 |access-date=9 August 2021 |agency=Associaeted Press |date=4 August 2021 |archive-date=9 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809043417/https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-science-climate-environment-and-nature-8752948ac9afcee5aec4811215dc7401 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Low-lying coastal regions ====
[[File:Cyclone Nargis flooding before-and-after.jpg|thumb|Floodplains and low-lying coastal areas will flood more frequently due to climate change, like this area of [[Myanmar]] which was submerged by [[Cyclone Nargis]]]]For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the [[coast]]. In developing countries, the poorest often live on [[floodplain]]s, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as [[Levee|dyke]]s and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.

Socioeconomic impacts of climate change in coastal and low-lying areas will be overwhelmingly adverse. The following impacts were projected in 2007 with very high confidence:<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Robert J. |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |title=Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |publisher=IPCC; Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0521880107 |editor-last=Parry |editor-first=M.L. |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=315–356 |section=Coastal systems and low-lying areas |display-authors=etal |access-date=6 June 2018 |editor-last2=Canziani |editor-first2=O.F. |editor-last3=Palutikof |editor-first3=J.P. |editor-last4=van der Linden |editor-first4=P.J. |editor-last5=Hanson |editor-first5=C.E. |display-editors=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122140622/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |archive-date=22 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
*Coastal and low-lying areas would be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion due to climate change and sea level rise.
*By the 2080s, millions of people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying mega-deltas of Asia and Africa; and smaller islands were judged to be especially vulnerable.
