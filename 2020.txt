Source: [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|NASA]].]] Regional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. The [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], small islands, [[Asia]]n [[river delta|megadeltas]] and [[Climate change in the Middle East and North Africa|the Middle East]] are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change.<ref name="ar4 especially affected regions">{{citation|author=IPCC|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains3-3-3.html Sec. 3.3.3 Especially affected systems, sectors and regions]|chapter=Synthesis report|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/main.html}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}. </ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Waha |first1=Katharina |title=Climate change impacts in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region and their implications for vulnerable population groups |journal=Regional Environmental Change |date=April 2017 |doi=10.1007/s10113-017-1144-2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316057764_Climate_change_impacts_in_the_Middle_East_and_Northern_Africa_MENA_region_and_their_implications_for_vulnerable_population_groups |accessdate=25 May 2020}}</ref> [[Tropics|Low-latitude]], [[developing country|less-developed]] regions are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change.<ref name="schneider distribution of impacts">{{citation|author=Schneider, S.H.|first=|title=In {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007|p=796}}|volume=|pages=|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-7.html Distribution of Impacts, in: Sec 19.3.7 Update on 'Reasons for Concern']|chapter=Ch 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|display-authors=etal}} </ref> [[Developed countries]] are also vulnerable to climate change.<ref name="schneider regional vulnerabilities">{{citation|author=Schneider, S.H.|at=[http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-3.html Sec 19.3.3 Regional vulnerabilities]|chapter=Ch 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change|chapter-url=http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007|p=792}} </ref> For example, developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some [[extreme weather]] events, such as [[heat wave]]s.<ref name="schneider regional vulnerabilities" /> Projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale.<ref name="nrc 2008 climate change brochure">{{cite book|url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/booklets/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.
