Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the oceans]] and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]]. ===Observed impacts=== With very high confidence, Rosenzweig ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name="rosenzweig observed impacts"/> concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases. Impacts include earlier leafing of [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s over many regions; movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; changes in [[bird migration]]s in Europe, North America and Australia; and shifting of the oceans' [[plankton]] and [[fish]] from cold- to warm-adapted communities.<ref name="nasa briefs"/> The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming, with greater temperature increases over land and in [[polar region]]s rather than over the oceans.<ref name="nrc 2008 climate change brochure"> {{cite book | year=2008 | title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.

It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations. However, the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings. The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of [[hunger]] compared with reference scenarios with no climate change. Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development. Additionally, the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development. In 2006, the global estimate for the number of people [[malnutrition|undernourished]] was 820 million.<ref> {{cite web | date=30 October 2006 | title=World hunger increasing | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Newsroom | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000433/index.html | accessdate=2011-07-07 }} </ref> Under the SRES A1, B1, and B2 scenarios (see the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#Scenario families|SRES article]] for information on each scenario group), projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560-700&nbsp;million people, with a global total of undernourished people of 100-240&nbsp;million in 2080. By contrast, the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels. The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario. ====Droughts and agriculture==== Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/wcc.81}}</ref> However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature11575}}</ref> Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.049}}</ref> Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1108/09653561111161752}}</ref> ===Health=== {{Main|Effects of global warming on human health}} Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al.'', 2007:393).<ref name="health summary"> {{citation |author = Confalonieri ''et al.'' |chapter = Chapter 8: Human health |chapter-url = http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8.html |at= [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch8s8-es.html Executive summary] }}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}. </ref> According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri ''et al.''

Not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates, for example, the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded. Climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3% of [[diarrhoea]], 3% of [[malaria]], and 3.8% of [[dengue fever]] deaths worldwide in 2004.

Benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries. With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name="health summary"/>{{Rp|393|date=November 2012}} concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change.
