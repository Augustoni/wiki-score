{{pp-semi-protected|small=yes}} [[Image:Risks and Impacts of Global Warming.png|thumb|350px|Graphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].]]The predicted '''effects of [[global warming]]''' on the [[natural environment|environment]] and for [[civilization|human life]] are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent [[climate change]] may already be occurring. [[Sea level rise|Raising sea levels]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Arctic shrinkage]], and altered patterns of [[Climate change and agriculture|agriculture]] are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include [[extreme weather]] events, an expansion of [[tropical diseases]], [[phenology|changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems]], and drastic [[Economics of global warming|economic impact]]. Concerns have led to [[Politics of global warming|political]] activism advocating proposals to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]], [[zero-carbon|eliminate]], or [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt]] to it. The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects. ==Overview== Potential climate changes due to [[global warming]] may lead to future large-scale and possibly irreversible effects at continental and global scales. The likelihood, magnitude, and timing is uncertain and [[Global warming controversy|controversial]], but some examples of projected climate changes include significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], large reductions in the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]s, accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial [[biosphere]], and releases of terrestrial carbon from [[permafrost]] regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments. The probability of one or more of these changes occurring is likely to increase with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change. Additionally, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] has stated, "greenhouse warming and other human alterations of the earth system may increase the possibility of large, abrupt, and unwelcome regional or global climatic events. . . . Future abrupt changes cannot be predicted with confidence, and climate surprises are to be expected."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10136&page=1 |title= Executive Summary |accessdate=2007-05-07 |format= [[PHP]] |work= Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises |publisher= [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] |month= June |year= 2002}}</ref> The IPCC reports that the effects of global warming will be mixed across regions. For smaller values of warming (1 to 3&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]), changes are expected to produce net benefits in some regions and for some activities, and net costs for others. Greater warming may produce net costs (or to reduce the benefits from smaller warming) in all regions. Developing countries are vulnerable to reduced economic growth as a result of warming.<ref name="WG2 AR4 SPM">{{cite book | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-spm.pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | title=Summary for Policymakers.

As the climate grows warmer and the causes of global dimming are reduced, [[evaporation]] will increase due to warmer oceans. Because the world is a closed system this will cause heavier [[rainfall]], with more [[erosion]]. This erosion, in turn, can in vulnerable tropical areas (especially in Africa) lead to [[desertification]] due to [[tropical deforestation|deforestation]]. On the other hand, in other areas, increased rainfall lead to growth of forests in dry desert areas. Scientists have found evidence that increased evaporation could result in more extreme [[weather]] as global warming progresses. The IPCC Third Annual Report says: "...global average water vapor concentration and precipitation are projected to increase during the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes and [[Antarctica]] in winter. At low latitudes there are both regional increases and decreases over land areas.

Pelto |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>. Despite their proximity and importance to [[world population|human populations]], the mountain and valley glaciers of temperate latitudes amount to a small fraction of glacial ice on the earth. About 99% is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar Antarctica and Greenland. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, 3 km (1.8 miles) or more in thickness, cap the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean. [[Image:Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland]] Glacier retreat has been observed in these outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate. In [[Greenland]] the period since the year 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched, Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, jointly drain more than 16% of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]]. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, retreating 7.2 km (4.5 miles) between 2001 and 2005. It has also accelerated from 20 m (65 ft)/day to 32 m (104 ft)/day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp |title=Rapidly accelerating glaciers may increase how fast the sea level rises|author=Emily Saarman|publisher=UC Santa Cruz Currents |date= 2005-11-14 |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] in west Greenland is generally considered the fastest moving glacier in the world.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. ====Sea level rise==== [[Image:Recent Sea Level Rise.png|right|thumb|300px|Sea level has been rising {{#expr: 20/120 round 1}} cm/year, based on measurements of [[sea level rise]] from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments]] {{main|Sea level rise}} With increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in glaciers, for example, the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s. An increase of 1.5 to 4.5 °C is estimated to lead to an increase of 15 to 95 cm (IPCC 2001). The sea level has risen more than 120 metres since the peak of the last [[ice age]] about 18,000 years ago. The bulk of that occurred before 6000 years ago. From 3000 years ago to the start of the 19th century, sea level was almost constant, rising at 0.1 to 0.2 [[Millimetre|mm]]/yr; since 1900, the level has risen at an average of 1.7 mm/yr <ref name=ar4wg1ch5>{{cite web |publisher= Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. |author=Bindoff, N.L., J.

Oceans currently absorb about one tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> per person per year.

This would affect in particular areas like [[Scandinavia]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]]. More significantly, it could lead to an [[oceanic anoxic event]]. The chances of this near-term collapse of the circulation are unclear; there is some evidence for the short-term stability of the Gulf Stream and possible weakening of the North Atlantic drift. However, the degree of weakening, and whether it will be sufficient to shut down the circulation, is under debate. As yet, no cooling has been found in northern Europe or nearby seas. ==Abrupt and irreversible effects== The scientific consensus in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that "Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change." ====Abrupt effects==== Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land could imply metres of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation of low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and low-lying islands. Such changes are projected to occur over millennial time scales, but more rapid sea level rise on century time scales cannot be excluded.<ref>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group II Report "Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability". Chapter 6: Coastal Systems and Low Lying Areas. http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter6.pdf</ref> ====Irreversible effects==== Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible effects. There is medium confidence that approximately 20- 30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5°C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5°C,model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe. At the scale of 7°C temperature increase, emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] caused by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] may cause by a severe [[anoxic event]]. This will adversely affect marine ecologies. ==Positive feedback effects== Some of the observed and potential effects of global warming are [[positive feedback]]s, contributing directly to further global warming. ====Methane release from melting permafrost peat bogs==== {{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}} Western Siberia is the world's largest [[peat bog]], a one million square kilometer region of [[permafrost]] peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last [[ice age]]. The melting of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of [[methane]]. As much as 70,000 million [[tonne]]s of methane, an extremely effective greenhouse gas, might be released over the next few decades, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725124.500 |title=Climate warning as Siberia melts |author=Fred Pearce |publisher=New Scientist |date= 2005-08-11|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>. Similar melting has been observed in eastern [[Siberia]] <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=56&ItemID=8482 |title=Warming Hits 'Tipping Point' |author=Ian Sample |publisher=Guardian |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>. ====Methane release from hydrates==== {{main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}} [[Methane clathrate]], also called methane hydrate, is a form of [[water (molecule)|water]] [[ice]] that contains a large amount of [[methane]] within its [[crystal]] structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Positive feedback and runaway greenhouse effect|runaway greenhouse effect]], has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmophere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. ====Carbon cycle feedbacks==== There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/abs/408184a0.html |journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |title=Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model |first=Peter M. |last=Cox |coauthors=Richard A.

All 11 models in the [[C4MIP]] study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO<sub>2</sub> varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI3800.1 |journal=Journal of Climate |title=Climate–Carbon Cycle Feedback Analysis: Results from the C4MIP Model Intercomparison |volume=19 |number =14 |pages=3337–3353 |year=2006 | first=P. |last=Friedlingstein |coauthors= P.

The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude [[taiga|boreal forests]] of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular ([[HadCM3]]) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,965721,00.html |title=5.5C temperature rise in next century| publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-05-29|accessdate=2008-01-02}}</ref>. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming.

This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Forests/Forests_101/FIRE/Climate_Change.asp | title=Climate Change and Fire | publisher=[[David Suzuki Foundation]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/ImpactsForests.html | title=Global warming : Impacts : Forests | accessdate=2007-05-17 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=2000-01-07 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.whrc.org/southamerica/fire_savann/FeedbackCycles.htm | title= Feedback Cycles: linking forests, climate and landuse activities | publisher=[[Woods Hole Research Center]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> ====Retreat of sea ice==== [[Image:Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|right|thumb|Northern Hemisphere ice trends]] [[Image:Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent Anomalies.png|right|thumb|Southern Hemisphere ice trends]] The sea absorbs heat from the sun, while the ice largely reflects the sun rays back to space. Thus, retreating sea ice will allow the sun to warm the now exposed sea water, contributing to further warming. The mechanism is the same as when a black car heats up faster in sunlight than a white car. This [[albedo]] change is also the main reason why [[IPCC]] predict polar temperatures in the northern hemisphere to rise up to twice as much as those of the rest of the world.

At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: "A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer|first=David|year=2005|title= Fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> in geologic time |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=110 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002625|pages= C09S05}} </ref>. However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]]. Also, the [[thermal radiation]] of the Earth rises in proportion to the fourth power of temperature, increasing the amount of outgoing radiation as the Earth warms. The impact of this negative feedback effect is included in [[global climate model]]s summarized by the [[IPCC]]. ==Other consequences== [[Image:Edccc.jpg|right|thumb|300px|As recent estimates of the rate of global warming have increased, so have the financial estimates of the damage costs.<ref>Adapted from a portion of Figure 1 in Tol and Yohe (2006) "A Review of the Stern Review" ''World Economics'' '''7'''(4): 233-50.</ref>]] ===Economic and social=== {{seealso|Economics of global warming}} Many estimates of aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe, the social cost of carbon (SCC), expressed in terms of future net benefits and costs that are discounted to the present, are now available.

In a 2004 comment on the economic effect of global warming in [[Copenhagen Consensus]], Professor [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] of Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, stated that :"A series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits (see Fankhauser et al 1997; Mendelsohn and Newmann 1999; Tol 1999; Mendelsohn et al 2000; Mendelsohn 2001;Maddison 2001; Tol 2002; Sohngen et al 2002; Pearce 2003; Mendelsohn and Williams 2004). These new studies imply that impacts depend heavily upon initial temperatures (latitude). Countries in the polar region are likely to receive large benefits from warming, countries in the mid-latitudes will at first benefit and only begin to be harmed if temperatures rise above 2.5C (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Only countries in the tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be harmed immediately by warming and be subject to the magnitudes of impacts first thought likely (Mendelsohn et al 2000). Summing these regional impacts across the globe implies that warming benefits and damages will likely offset each other until warming passes 2.5C and even then it will be far smaller on net than originally thought (Mendelsohn and Williams 2004)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=165 |title=Opponent paper on climate change |publisher= Copenhagen Consensus 2004|author=Robert Mendelsohn |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> ====Insurance==== An industry very directly affected by the risks is the [[insurance]] industry; the number of major natural disasters has tripled since the 1960s, and insured losses increased fifteenfold in real terms (adjusted for inflation).<ref>[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf Viewpoint] American Association of Insurance Services</ref> According to one study, 35&ndash;40% of the worst catastrophes have been climate change related.

Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with [[Salmon]] and [[Cutthroat trout]].

Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the worlds oceans, may affect existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well. ====Forests==== [[Image:Northern Forest Trend in Photosynthetic Activity.gif|thumb|250px|right]] Pine forests in [[British Columbia]] have been devastated by a [[pine beetle]] infestation, which has expanded unhindered since 1998 at least in part due to the lack of severe winters since that time; a few days of extreme cold kill most mountain pine beetles and have kept outbreaks in the past naturally contained. The infestation, which will have killed 50% of the lodgepole pines by 2008 <ref> [http://mpb.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index_e.html Natural Resources Canada] </ref> has passed to Alberta and will spread further East and eventually into America given continued milder winters. Besides the immediate ecological and economic impact, the huge dead forests provide a fire risk as well. Forests in some regions potentially face an increased risk of [[forest fire]]s. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000 km² (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000 km² (7 million acres) annually.<ref>[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/education/alaska/ak-edu-5.htm US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change] Regional Paper: Alaska</ref>. This change may be due in part to changes in forest management practices. In the western U. S., since 1986, longer, warmer summers have resulted in a fourfold increase of major wildfires and a sixfold increase in the area of forest burned, compared to the period from 1970 to 1986. A similar increase in wildfire activity has been reported in Canada from 1920 to 1999.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/313/5789/927 Science Magazine - August 2006 "Is Global Warming Causing More, Larger Wildfires?" - Steven W.

Changes in global climate pose a number of potential risks to mountain habitats<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VFV-4MY0TS1-1&_user=4225319&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2007&_rdoc=12&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236020%232007%23999829996%23668309%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6020&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=17&_acct=C000048559&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4225319&md5=b28529ce89b28da5f49792dfebeef70b&errMsg=1 Exposure of global mountain systems to climate warming during the 21st Century] Science Direct</ref>. Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of [[forest fires]], the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of water. Studies suggest that a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/potential_effects.pdf The Potential Effects Of Global Climate Change On The United States] Report to Congress Editors: Joel B. Smith and Dennis Tirpak US-EPA December 1989</ref> Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Freshwater Issues at ‘Heart of Humankind’S Hopes for Peace and Development’ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2002-12-12]] | url = http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/ENVDEV713.doc.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> ====Ecological productivity==== Increasing average temperature and carbon dioxide may have the effect of improving ecosystems' productivity. In [[photorespiration]], carbon dioxide that oxygen can enter a plant's [[chloroplasts]] and take the place of carbon dioxide in the [[Calvin cycle]]. This causes the sugars being made to be destroyed, suppressing growth. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations tend to reduce photorespiration. Satellite data shows that the productivity of the northern hemisphere has increased since 1982 (although attribution of this increase to a specific cause is difficult). IPCC models predict that higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would only spur growth of flora up to a point, because in many regions the limiting factors are water or nutrients, not temperature or CO<sub>2</sub>; after that, greenhouse effects and warming would continue but there would be no compensatory increase in growth. Research done by the [http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/scc/index.shtml Swiss Canopy Crane Project] suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while faster growing plants like [[liana]] benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in [[rain forest]]s, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. ===Environmental=== Secondary evidence of global warming &mdash; reduced snow cover, rising sea levels, weather changes &mdash; provides examples of consequences of global warming that may influence not only human activities but also [[ecosystem]]s. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems may change; some [[species]] may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Few of the [[terrestrial ecoregions]] on Earth could expect to be unaffected. Increasing carbon dioxide may increase ecosystems' productivity to a point. Ecosystems' unpredictable interactions with other aspects of [[climate change]] makes the possible environmental impact of this is unclear, though. An increase in the total amount of [[biomass]] produced may not be necessarily positive: [[biodiversity]] can still decrease even though a relatively small number of species are flourishing. ====Water scarcity==== {{seealso|Water crisis}} Sea level rise is projected to increase salt-water intrusion into [[groundwater]] in some regions, affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/GlobalWarming.nsf/content/ResourceCenterPublicationsSeaLevelRiseIndex.html EPA : Global Warming : Resource Center : Publications : Sea Level Rise : Sea Level Rise Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increased evaporation will reduce the effectiveness of reservoirs. Increased extreme weather means more water falls on hardened ground unable to absorb it, leading to flash floods instead of a replenishment of soil moisture or groundwater levels. In some areas, shrinking glaciers threaten the water supply.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/kazakhstan_2551.jsp Kazakhstan: glaciers and geopolitics] ''Stephan Harrison'' Open Democracy May 2005</ref> The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.{{ref_harv|peru2|BBC|BBC}} Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower. Higher temperatures will also increase the demand for water for the purposes of cooling and hydration. In the [[Sahel]], there has been an unusually wet period from 1950 until 1970, followed by [[Sahel drought|extremely dry years]] from 1970 to 1990.
