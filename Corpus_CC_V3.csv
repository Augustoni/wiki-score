The '''effects of climate change''' span the impacts on [[physical environment]], [[ecosystems]] and human societies due to ongoing human-caused [[climate change]]. The future impact of climate change depends on how much nations reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapt]] to climate change.<ref name=""adaptation and mitigation"">Oppenheimer, M., ''et al.'', ''Section 19.7.1: Relationship between Adaptation Efforts, Mitigation Efforts, and Residual Impacts,'' in: [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf Chapter 19: Emergent risks and key vulnerabilities] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20141020014746/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf 20 October 2014]), pp.1080–1085, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}

In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the [[tropics]]. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing [[Ocean current|currents in the oceans]].

Physical changes include [[extreme weather]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], sea level rise, [[Arctic sea ice decline|declines in Arctic sea ice]], and changes in the timing of seasonal events (such as earlier spring flowering). Since 1970, the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the [[ocean heat content|excess heat]] in the climate system. Even if global surface temperature is stabilized, sea levels will continue to rise and the ocean will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere for many centuries.<ref name=""ReferenceA"" /> The uptake of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]] is leading to [[ocean acidification]].<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite book|title=IPCC SROCC Summary for Policymakers|year=2019|page=9}}</ref>

[[Food security]] and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures. Climate change has profound impacts on human health, directly via heat stress and indirectly via the spread of infectious diseases. 

The vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries.

If emissions of {{CO2}} were to be abruptly stopped and no [[negative emission technologies]] deployed, the Earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state.

Mitigation policies currently in place will result in about 2.7&nbsp;°C (2.0–3.6&nbsp;°C, depending on how [[climate sensitivity|sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions]]) warming above pre-industrial levels. If all unconditional pledges and targets made by governments are achieved the temperature will rise by around 2.4&nbsp;°C. If  additionally all the countries that adopted or are considering to adopt net-zero targets will achieve it the temperature will rise by a median of 1.8&nbsp;°C. There is a substantial gap between national plans and commitments and actions so far taken by governments around the world.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126022845/https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/|archive-date=26 January 2022|date=9 November 2021|url=https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/|title= Temperatures|work=Climate Action Tracker}}</ref>

=== Precipitation (rainfall) ===
{{See also|Effects of climate change on the water cycle}}

Warming by greenhouse gas forcing has increased contrasts in rainfall amounts between wet and dry seasons.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6, line 51}}</ref> This means colloquially: ""wet seasons are getting wetter, dry seasons are getting drier"". Warming has also resulted in a detectable increase in the precipitation of northern [[Polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]].<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8"" />

Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation and surface drying. As the air warms, its water-holding capacity also increases, particularly over the oceans. Air holds 7% more [[water vapour]] for every degree Celsius it is warmed.<ref name=""IPCC AR6 Ch8_b2"">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Ch8|2021|p=8-6,8–119}}</ref> Changes have already been observed in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation.

Global warming is expected to be accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some [[equatorial region]]s. In other words, regions which are dry at present will generally become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will generally become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, [[South Africa]], [[southern Australia]], the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]], and the [[Southwestern United States|south-western U.S.]]), a pattern that can be described as a poleward expansion of these semi-arid zones.<!-- This entire paragraph is based on the following reference --><ref name=""NOAA_GFDL_b"">

In the case of [[precipitation]], the rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's [[water cycle]], increasing evaporation. Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense downpours and cause extended droughts in certain regions. As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and an increased risk of flooding. In contrast, areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern [[latitudes]], and least warming over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=IPCC_synthesis_2007>

Global warming not only causes changes in tropical cyclones, it may also make some impacts from them worse via sea level rise.

Even though weather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires, the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased globally. This is mostly the result of the conversion of [[savanna]] into [[croplands]], after which there is less forest area that can burn. [[Prescribed burning]], an indigenous practice in the US and Australia, can reduce the area burnt too, and may form an adaptation to increased risk.<ref name="":13"" /> The carbon released from wildfires can further increase greenhouse gas concentrations.

These physical changes disturb marine ecosystems, which can cause both extinctions and population explosions, change the distribution of species,<ref name=""SROCC_SPM_20190925"" /> and impact coastal fishing and tourism.

The reduced up and down mixing reduces the ability of the ocean to absorb heat, directing a larger fraction of future warming toward the atmosphere and land. Energy available for tropical cyclones and other storms is expected to increase, [[nutrient]]s for fish in the upper ocean layers are set to decrease, as well as the capacity of the oceans to [[Carbon sink|store carbon]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Freedman|first=Andrew|date=29 September 2020|title=Mixing of the planet's ocean waters is slowing down, speeding up global warming, study finds|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/29/global-ocean-layers-warming/|url-status=live|access-date=12 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015040856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/29/global-ocean-layers-warming/|archive-date=15 October 2020|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Warmer water cannot contain as much oxygen as cold water, changing the gas exchange equilibrium to reduce ocean oxygen levels and increase oxygen in the atmosphere. Increased thermal stratification may lead to increases in respiration rates of organic matter, further decreasing water oxygen content. The ocean has already lost oxygen, throughout the entire water column and [[oxygen minimum zone]]s are expanding worldwide.<ref name="":0"" /> This has adverse consequences for ocean life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crowley|first1=T.

[[Water resources]] can be affected by climate change in various ways. The total amount of [[freshwater]] available can change, for instance due to [[dry spell]]s or droughts. Heavy rainfall and flooding can have an impact on water quality: pollutants can be transported into water bodies by the increased [[surface runoff]]. In coastal regions, more salt may find its way into water resources due to higher sea levels and more intense storms. Higher temperatures also directly degrade water quality: warm water contains less oxygen.<ref name=""IPCC2022_FAQ4.1"" />{{excerpt|Water security#Climate change|paragraphs=1–2|file=no}}

Economic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably. Researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the impact of potentially catastrophic climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages. Nevertheless, one 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2&nbsp;°C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kompas|first1=Tom|last2=Pham|first2=Van Ha|last3=Che|first3=Tuong Nhu|date=2018|title=The Effects of Climate Change on GDP by Country and the Global Economic Gains From Complying With the Paris Climate Accord|journal=Earth's Future|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1029/2018EF000922|issn=2328-4277|doi-access=free|bibcode=2018EaFut...6.1153K}}</ref>

[[Thermal power station]]s (fossil fuel plants and [[nuclear power plants]]) depend on water to cool them.

[[Insurance]] is an important tool to manage risks, but often unavailable to poorer households.

=== Displacement and migration ===
{{Further|Climate migrant}}
Climate change affects displacement of people in several ways. Firstly, involuntary displacement may increase through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats. Effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments.

Gradual but pervasive environmental change and sudden natural disasters both influence the nature and extent of human migration but in different ways.

Governments have considered various approaches to reduce migration compelled by environmental conditions in at-risk communities, including programs of social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management.  Some experts support migration as an appropriate way for people to cope with environmental changes.  However, this is controversial because migrants – particularly low-skilled ones – are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<ref name=""beta.adb.org""/>

Climate change can worsen conflicts by exacerbating tensions over limited resources like [[drinking water]] (in the case of [[Water conflict|water conflicts]]).

==== Low-lying coastal regions ====
[[File:Cyclone Nargis flooding before-and-after.jpg|thumb|Floodplains and low-lying coastal areas will flood more frequently due to climate change, like this area of [[Myanmar]] which was submerged by [[Cyclone Nargis]]]]For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the [[coast]]. In developing countries, the poorest often live on [[floodplain]]s, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as [[Levee|dyke]]s and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.

Socioeconomic impacts of climate change in coastal and low-lying areas will be overwhelmingly adverse. The following impacts were projected in 2007 with very high confidence:<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Robert J. |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |title=Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |publisher=IPCC; Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0521880107 |editor-last=Parry |editor-first=M.L. |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=315–356 |section=Coastal systems and low-lying areas |display-authors=etal |access-date=6 June 2018 |editor-last2=Canziani |editor-first2=O.F. |editor-last3=Palutikof |editor-first3=J.P. |editor-last4=van der Linden |editor-first4=P.J. |editor-last5=Hanson |editor-first5=C.E. |display-editors=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122140622/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch6.html |archive-date=22 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
*Coastal and low-lying areas would be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion due to climate change and sea level rise.
*By the 2080s, millions of people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying mega-deltas of Asia and Africa; and smaller islands were judged to be especially vulnerable.

Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling. Scientists then often used the term ''inadvertent climate modification'' to refer to the human impact on the climate. In the 1980s, the terms ''global warming'' and ''climate change'' were popularised. The former refers only to increased surface warming, the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.<ref name=""Conway 2008"">{{harvnb|NASA, 5 December|2008}}.</ref> ''Global warming'' became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]] used it in his 1988 testimony in the [[U.S. Senate]].<ref name=""history.aip.org"" /> In the 2000s, the term ''climate change'' increased in popularity.<ref>{{harvnb|Joo|Kim|Do|Lineman|2015}}.</ref> ''Global warming'' usually refers to human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas ''climate change'' can refer to natural or anthropogenic change.<ref>{{harvnb|NOAA, 17 June|2015}}: ""when scientists or public leaders talk about global warming these days, they almost always mean human-caused warming""; {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Glossary|2014|p=120}}: ""Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.

=== Greenhouse gases ===
{{Main|Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse gas emissions|Greenhouse effect|Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere}}
The Earth absorbs [[sunlight]], then [[Radiative cooling|radiates it as heat]]. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit [[infrared]] radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Causes of Climate Change|author=NASA |url=https://climate.nasa.gov/causes|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=8 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508000022/https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/|archive-date=8 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33&nbsp;°C warmer than it would have been in their absence.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1 Ch1|2007|loc=FAQ1.1}}: ""To emit 240 W m<sup>−2</sup>, a surface would have to have a temperature of around −19&nbsp;°C.

Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant [[carbon sink]] for {{CO2}}. Natural processes, such as [[carbon fixation]] in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 29% of annual global {{CO2}} emissions.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|2019|p=10}}</ref> The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, {{CO2}} dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's [[Thermohaline circulation|overturning circulation]] distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted {{CO2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SROCC Ch5|2019|p=450}}.</ref>

=== Aerosols and clouds ===
[[Air pollution]], in the form of [[aerosol]]s, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also [[Particulates#Climate effects|affects the climate]] on a large scale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haywood|2016|p=456}}; {{harvnb|McNeill|2017}}; {{harvnb|Samset|Sand|Smith|Bauer|2018}}.</ref> From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of [[irradiance|sunlight reaching the Earth's surface]] was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as ''[[global dimming]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Ch2|2013|p=183}}.</ref> typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.<ref>{{harvnb|He|Wang|Zhou|Wild|2018}}; {{Harvnb|Storelvmo|Phillips|Lohmann|Leirvik|2016}}</ref> Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.<ref>{{harvnb|Wild|Gilgen|Roesch|Ohmura|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Storelvmo|Phillips|Lohmann|Leirvik|2016}}; {{harvnb|Samset|Sand|Smith|Bauer|2018}}.</ref>

Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. They also have indirect effects on the [[Earth's energy budget|Earth's radiation budget]]. Sulfate aerosols act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.<ref>{{harvnb|Twomey|1977}}.</ref> They also reduce the [[Cloud physics#Collision-coalescence|growth of raindrops]], which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.<ref>{{harvnb|Albrecht|1989}}.</ref> Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.<ref name=USGCRP_2017_ch2/>

While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, [[black carbon]] in [[soot]] that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramanathan|Carmichael|2008}}; {{harvnb|RIVM|2016}}.</ref> Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2&nbsp;°C by 2050.<ref>{{harvnb|Sand|Berntsen|von Salzen|Flanner|2015}}</ref>

=== Land surface changes ===
[[File:20210331 Global tree cover loss - World Resources Institute.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|The rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since 2001, to an annual loss approaching an area the size of Italy.<ref>{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, 31 March|2021}}</ref>]]
Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more [[agricultural land]]. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).<ref>{{harvnb|Ritchie|Roser|2018}}</ref> The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.<ref>{{harvnb|The Sustainability Consortium, 13 September|2018}}; {{harvnb|UN FAO|2016|p=18}}.</ref> [[Deforestation]] releases {{CO2}} contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more {{CO2}} in the future.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|2019|p=18}}</ref> The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term [[shifting cultivation]] (24%), and wildfires (23%).<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Slay|Harris|Tyukavina|2018}}</ref>

Land use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions. The type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature. It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space ([[albedo]]), and how much [[evaporative cooling|heat is lost by evaporation]]. For instance, the change from a dark [[forest]] to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.<ref name=""Seymour 2019"">{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, 8 December|2019}}</ref> In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.<ref name=""Seymour 2019"" /> Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.<ref name=""IPCC Special Report: Climate change and Land p2-54"">{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Ch2|2019|p=172|ps=: ""The global biophysical cooling alone has been estimated by a larger range of climate models and is −0.10 ± 0.14&nbsp;°C; it ranges from −0.57&nbsp;°C to +0.06°C&nbsp;...

====Energy conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
Reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=97}}</ref> If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises [[emission intensity|carbon-intensive]] infrastructure development.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Summary for Policymakers|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|IEA|2020b}}</ref> Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=155|loc=Fig. 2.27}}</ref> Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.<ref>{{harvnb|IEA|2020b}}</ref>

Strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=142}}</ref> Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|pp=138–140}}</ref> In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|pp=141–142}}</ref> The use of technologies like [[heat pump]]s can also increase building energy efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG3 Ch9|2014|pp=686–694}}.</ref>

====Agriculture and industry====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture|Green industrial policy}}
Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.<ref>{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, December|2019|p=1}}</ref> A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels. These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.<ref>{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, December|2019|pp=1, 3}}</ref>

On the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards [[plant-based diets]].<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL|2019|p=22|loc=B.6.2}}</ref> Eliminating the production of livestock for [[Environmental impact of meat production|meat and dairy]] would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Ch5|2019|pp=487,488|loc=FIGURE 5.12}} Humans on a vegan exclusive diet would save about 7.9 Gt{{CO2}} equivalent per year by 2050 {{harvnb|IPCC AR6 WG1 Technical Summary|2021|p=51}} Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use used an average of 12 Gt{{CO2}} per year between 2007 and 2016 (23% of total anthropogenic emissions).</ref> Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Ch5|2019|pp=82, 162|loc=FIGURE 1.1}}</ref>

Steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial {{CO2}} emissions. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing {{CO2}} emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Low and zero emissions in the steel and cement industries|url=https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/GGSD2019_IssuePaper_CementSteel.pdf|pages=11, 19–22}}</ref>

==== Carbon sequestration ====
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage|Carbon dioxide removal|Carbon sequestration}}
[[File:Carbon Dioxide Partitioning.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Most {{CO2}} emissions have been absorbed by carbon sinks, including plant growth, soil uptake, and ocean uptake ([[Global Carbon Project#Global Carbon Budget|2020 Global Carbon Budget]]).]]
Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of {{CO2}} beyond naturally occurring levels.<ref>{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, 8 August|2019}}: {{harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Ch2|2019|pp=189–193}}.</ref> Reforestation and [[Afforestation|tree planting on non-forest lands]] are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns.<ref>{{harvnb|Kreidenweis|Humpenöder|Stevanović|Bodirsky|2016}}</ref> [[Regenerative agriculture|Soil carbon sequestration]] and [[blue carbon|coastal carbon sequestration]] are less understood options.<ref>{{harvnb|Ruseva|Hedrick|Marland|Tovar|2020}}</ref> The feasibility of land-based negative emissions methods for mitigation are uncertain; the IPCC has described mitigation strategies based on them as risky.{{Sfn|Krause|Pugh|Bayer|Li|2018|pp=3026–3027}}

Where energy production or {{CO2}}-intensive [[heavy industry|heavy industries]] continue to produce waste {{CO2}}, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere. Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive,<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch4|2018|pp=326–327}}; {{harvnb|Bednar|Obersteiner|Wagner|2019}}; {{harvnb|European Commission, 28 November|2018|p=188}}</ref> [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting {{CO2}} emissions by mid-century.{{Sfn|Bui|Adjiman|Bardow|Anthony|2018|p=1068}} This technique, in combination with bio-energy (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions: {{CO2}} is drawn from the atmosphere.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR|2014|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Bednar|Obersteiner|Wagner|2019}}.</ref> It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as BECCS, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C. Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15|2018|p=34}}</ref>

===Adaptation===
{{main|Climate change adaptation}}
Adaptation is ""the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects"".{{sfn|IPCC SR15 Ch4|2018|pp=396–397}} Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of ""severe, widespread and irreversible"" impacts.{{sfn|IPCC AR5 SYR|2014|p=17}} More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.{{sfn|IPCC SR15 Ch4|2018|pp=396–397}} The [[Adaptive capacity|capacity and potential for humans to adapt]] is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2 Ch19|2007|p=796}}.</ref> The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic [[sanitation]] and electricity, but progress is slow. Many countries have implemented adaptation policies. However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.{{sfn|UNEP|2018|pp=xii–xiii}}

Adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection. If that fails, [[managed retreat]] may be needed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stephens |first1=Scott A |last2=Bell|first2=Robert G|last3=Lawrence|first3=Judy|date=2018|title=Developing signals to trigger adaptation to sea-level rise|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=13|issue=10|at=104004 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aadf96 |bibcode=2018ERL....13j4004S|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}</ref> There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact.

[[Climate change and ecosystems|Ecosystems adapt to climate change]], a process that can be supported by human intervention. By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions. Species can also be [[Assisted migration|introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate]]. Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt. Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via [[ecosystem-based adaptation]]. For instance, restoration of [[Fire regime|natural fire regimes]] makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure. Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk. Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Morecroft |first1=Michael D.|last2=Duffield|first2=Simon|last3=Harley|first3=Mike|last4=Pearce-Higgins|first4=James W.|last5=Stevens|first5=Nicola|last6=Watts|first6=Olly|last7=Whitaker|first7=Jeanette|display-authors=4 |date=2019|title=Measuring the success of climate change adaptation and mitigation in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Science|volume=366|issue=6471|page=eaaw9256|doi=10.1126/science.aaw9256|issn=0036-8075 |pmid=31831643 |s2cid=209339286|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Countries that are most [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]] have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions. This raises questions about justice and fairness.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Summary for Policymakers|2014|loc=Section 3|p=17}}</ref> Climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development. Limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve [[sustainable development goals]], such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. The connection is recognised in [[Sustainable Development Goal 13]] which is to ""[t]ake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"".<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch5|2018|p=447}}; United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, [[:File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/71/313 A/RES/71/313])</ref> The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.{{sfn|IPCC SR15 Ch5|2018|p=477}}

The [[geopolitics]] of climate change is complex. It has often been framed as a [[free-rider problem]], in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves. This framing has been challenged. For instance, the benefits of a [[coal phase out|coal phase-out]] to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions.<ref name=""Rauner 2020"">{{harvnb|Rauner|Bauer|Dirnaichner|Van Dingenen|2020}}</ref> Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face [[stranded assets]]: fossil fuels they cannot sell.<ref>{{harvnb|Mercure|Pollitt|Viñuales|Edwards|2018}}</ref>

=== Policy options ===
A wide range of [[Policy|policies]], [[regulation]]s, and [[law]]s are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019, [[carbon pricing]] covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{harvnb|World Bank, June|2019|p=12|loc=Box 1}}</ref> Carbon can be priced with [[carbon tax]]es and [[Carbon emission trading|emissions trading systems]].<ref>{{harvnb|Union of Concerned Scientists, 8 January|2017}}; {{harvnb|Hagmann|Ho|Loewenstein|2019}}.</ref> Direct global [[fossil fuel subsidies]] reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|Amann|Arnell|Ayeb-Karlsson|2019|p=1866}}</ref> Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.<ref>{{harvnb|UN Human Development Report|2020|p=10}}</ref> Subsidies could be used to support the [[Renewable energy transition|transition to clean energy]] instead.<ref>{{harvnb|International Institute for Sustainable Development|2019|p=iv}}</ref> More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.<ref>{{harvnb|ICCT|2019|p=iv}}; {{harvnb|Natural Resources Defense Council, 29 September|2017}}</ref> Several countries [[Renewable portfolio standard|require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production]].<ref>{{harvnb|National Conference of State Legislators, 17 April|2020}}; {{harvnb|European Parliament, February|2020}}</ref>

Policy designed through the lens of [[climate justice]] tries to address [[human rights]] issues and social inequality. For instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gabbatiss|first1=Josh|last2=Tandon|first2=Ayesha|date=4 October 2021|title=In-depth Q&A: What is 'climate justice'?|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-what-is-climate-justice|access-date=16 October 2021|website=Carbon Brief|language=en}}</ref> As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost.

=== Denial and misinformation ===
{{Further|Global warming controversy|Fossil fuels lobby|Climate change denial|Global warming conspiracy theory}}
Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and [[misinformation]], which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, [[conservative think tanks]], and [[contrarian]] scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlap|McCright|2011|pp=144, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RsYr_iQUs6QC&pg=PA155 155]}}; {{harvnb|Björnberg|Karlsson|Gilek|Hansson|2017}}</ref> [[Tobacco industry playbook|Like the tobacco industry]], the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results.<ref>{{harvnb|Oreskes|Conway|2010}}; {{harvnb|Björnberg|Karlsson|Gilek|Hansson|2017}}</ref> Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as ""climate change skeptics"", which several scientists have noted is a [[misnomer]].<ref>{{harvnb|O’Neill|Boykoff|2010}}; {{harvnb|Björnberg|Karlsson|Gilek|Hansson|2017}}</ref>

There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change.<ref name=""Björnberg 2017"">{{harvnb|Björnberg|Karlsson|Gilek|Hansson|2017}}</ref> Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a [[manufactured controversy]]: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlap|McCright|2015|p=308}}.</ref> Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions,<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlap|McCright|2011|p=146}}.</ref> and questioning the motives of individual scientists.<ref name=""Björnberg 2017""/> An [[echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]] of climate-denying [[blogs]] and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|Van den Berg|Ellers|Kampen|2018}}</ref>

=== Public awareness and opinion ===
{{Further|Climate communication|Media coverage of climate change|Public opinion on climate change}}
Climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s.<ref name="":3"">{{harvnb|Weart ""The Public and Climate Change (since 1980)""}}</ref> Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.<ref name=""Newell2006"">{{harvnb|Newell|2006|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Yale Climate Connections, 2 November|2010}}</ref> [[Climate change in popular culture|In popular culture]], the  [[climate fiction]] movie ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (2004) and the [[Al Gore]] documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' (2006) focused on climate change.<ref name="":3"" />

Significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change.

{{Broader|History of climate change science}}

[[File:Tyndalls setup for measuring radiant heat absorption by gases annotated.svg|thumb|upright=1.35 |Tyndall's [[Spectrophotometry|ratio spectrophotometer]] (drawing from 1861) measured how much infrared radiation was absorbed and emitted by various gases filling its central tube.]]

In the 1820s, [[Joseph Fourier]] proposed the [[greenhouse effect]] to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain. Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to [[infrared|heat]] radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet.<ref>{{harvnb|Archer|Pierrehumbert|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPY9HOfnuS0C&pg=PA10 10–14]}}</ref> In 1856 [[Eunice Newton Foote]] demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. She concluded that ""An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...""<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xhFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA382|last=Foote|first=Eunice |title=Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun's Rays|work=The American Journal of Science and Arts|date=November 1856 |volume=22|pages=382–383|access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Huddleston|2019}}</ref> Starting in 1859,<ref>{{harvnb|Tyndall|1861}}.</ref> [[John Tyndall]] established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totalling 99% of dry air—are transparent to [[infrared|radiated heat]]. However, water vapour and some gases (in particular methane and carbon dioxide) absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat within the atmosphere. Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Archer|Pierrehumbert|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPY9HOfnuS0C&pg=PA39 39–42]}}; {{harvnb|Fleming|2008|loc=[http://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/GlobalWarming/Article3.html Tyndall]}}</ref>

[[Svante Arrhenius]] noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the {{co2}} concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes. At the end of an ice age, warming from increased {{co2}} levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a feedback loop. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of {{co2}} levels could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling {{co2}} to be around 5–6&nbsp;°C.{{snf|Lapenis|1998}} Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more {{co2}} would make no difference. They thought climate would be self-regulating.<ref name=""Weart The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect"">{{harvnb|Weart ""The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect""}}; {{harvnb|Fleming|2008|loc=[http://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/GlobalWarming/Article4.html Arrhenius]}}</ref> From 1938 onwards [[Guy Stewart Callendar]] published evidence that climate was warming and {{co2}} levels rising,<ref>{{harvnb|Callendar|1938}}; {{harvnb|Fleming|2007}}.</ref> but his calculations met the same objections.<ref name=""Weart The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect"" />

In the 1950s, [[Gilbert Plass]] created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing {{co2}} levels would cause warming. Around the same time, [[Hans Suess]] found evidence that {{co2}} levels had been rising, and [[Roger Revelle]] showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helped [[Charles David Keeling|Charles Keeling]] to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the ""[[Keeling Curve]]"".<ref name=""Weart The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect"" /> Scientists alerted the public,<ref>{{harvnb|Weart ""Suspicions of a Human-Caused Greenhouse (1956–1969)""}}</ref> and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony.<ref name=""history.aip.org"">{{harvnb|Weart ""The Public and Climate Change: The Summer of 1988""}}, [http://history.aip.org/climate/public2.htm#L_0575 ""News reporters gave only a little attention&nbsp;...""].</ref> The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary research]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2013|p=3567}}.</ref>

'''Climate change in Alabama''' encompasses the [[effects of climate change]], attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], in the U.S. state of [[Alabama]].

==Projected effects of climate change==
In 2016, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] released an assessment of the effect of climate change on Alabama, assessing various likely outcomes, noting that ""[c]hanging the climate is likely to increase damages from tropical storms, reduce crop yields, harm livestock, increase the number of unpleasantly hot days, and increase the risk of heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses"".<ref name=""EPA"">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-al.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for Alabama|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref> Other studies show that Alabama is among a string of ""[[Deep South]]"" states that will experience the worst effects of climate change.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/global-warming-american-south/532200/|title=The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change's Costs|first=Robinson|last=Meyer|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/climate-change-irony-brookings/index.html|title=Irony of climate change politics: Red states face more pain|first=Ronald|last=Brownstein|publisher=CNN|date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>

===Temperature===
""In the coming decades, Alabama will become warmer, and the state will probably experience more severe floods and drought. Unlike most of the nation, Alabama has not become warmer during the last 50 years. But soils have become drier, annual rainfall has increased in most of the state, more rain arrives in heavy downpours, and sea level is rising about one inch every eight years"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

""Sea level is rising more rapidly in Alabama than most coastal areas because the land is sinking. If the oceans and atmosphere continue to warm, sea level along the Alabama coast is likely to rise eighteen inches to four feet in the next century. Rising sea level submerges wetlands and dry land, erodes beaches, and exacerbates [[coastal flooding]]"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Precipitation===
[[File:Foley2014flood.png|thumb|right|Flooding of a small stream in June 2014 destroyed this roadbed in Foley, Alabama.]]
The EPA projects increased more extreme precipitation in the future. These extremes include much higher rainfall during spring, leading to more flooding events, and longer dry seasons, causing drought. Although rainfall during spring is likely to increase during the next 40 to 50 years, the total amount of water running off into rivers or recharging ground water is likely to decline 2.5 to 5 percent, as increased evaporation offsets the greater rainfall. [[Drought]]s are likely to be more severe, because periods without rain may be longer and very hot days will be more frequent"". At the same time, the increased rate of flooding observed since 1958 is expected to continue and increase<ref name=""EPA""/>

""Droughts create a different set of challenges. When reservoirs release water for navigation along the Tennessee or [[Black Warrior River|Black Warrior]] rivers, too little water may be available for lake recreation or [[hydropower]]. Low flows from drought occasionally limit navigation along the Alabama River. During severe droughts in the Mississippi River’s watershed, however, navigation can potentially increase on the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]], which provides an alternative route to the Gulf of Mexico"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Agriculture===
""Changing the climate will have both harmful and beneficial effects on farming. Seventy years from now, Alabama is likely to have 30 to 60 days per year with temperatures above 95°F, compared with about 15 days today. Even during the next few decades, hotter summers are likely to reduce yields of corn. But higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase crop yields, and that fertilizing effect is likely to offset the harmful effects of heat on soybeans, cotton, wheat, and peanuts—if adequate water is available. More severe droughts, however, could cause crop failures. Higher temperatures are also likely to reduce livestock productivity, because heat stress disrupts the animals' metabolism"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Risk to superfund sites===
On November 22, 2019, the [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] announced that the flooding, wildfires, and sealevel rise associated with climate change put eleven [[List of Superfund sites|Superfund sites]] in Alabama at risk.<ref name=""Superfund"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alreporter.com/2019/11/22/report-climate-change-threatens-11-alabama-superfund-sites/|title=Report: Climate change threatens 11 Alabama superfund sites|last=Burkhalter|first=Eddie|date=2019-11-22|website=Alabama Political Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

The sites are:

* Triana/Tennessee River, in [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone]]/[[Madison County, Alabama|Madison]]/[[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan]] AL (flood hazard)
* Interstate Lead Co. (ILCO), in [[Leeds, Alabama|Leeds, AL]]  (flood hazard)
* Alabama Plating Company, Inc., in [[Vincent, Alabama|Vincent, AL]] (high wildfire hazard potential, flood hazard)
* T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition Co. (Montgomery Plant), in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery, AL]] (flood hazard)
* Mowbray Engineering Co., in [[Greenville, Alabama|Greenville, AL]] (flood hazard)
* Olin Corp. (McIntosh Plant), in [[McIntosh, Alabama|McIntosh, AL]] (high wildfire hazard potential, flood hazard)
* Ciba-Geigy Corp. (McIntosh Plant), in [[McIntosh, Alabama|McIntosh, AL]]  (high wildfire hazard potential, flood hazard)
* Stauffer Chemical Co. (Lemoyne Plant), in [[Axis, Alabama|Axis, AL]]  (high wildfire hazard potential)
* Perdido Ground Water Contamination, in [[Perdido, Alabama|Perdido, AL]] (high wildfire hazard potential)
* Redwing Carriers, Inc. (Saraland), in [[Saraland, Alabama|Saraland, AL]] (high wildfire hazard potential, flood hazard, at risk in Category 4 or 5 hurricanes)
* American Brass Inc., in [[Headland, Alabama|Headland, AL]] (specific hazard not identified)<ref name=""Superfund"" />

== Observed effects of climate change ==
A primary global effect of climate change is climatic temperature changes. However, the EPA notes that Alabama is unusual in that local temperatures have  not increased in the state in the fifty years between 1966 and 2016.<ref name=""EPA""/> However, significant changes in rainfall has occurred. Rainfall has become more 'lumpy,' with longer periods of low rainfall and drought, as well as more intensely wet and rainy spring seasons. Overall rainfall has increased 5-10%, while the amount of precipitation during heavy rain events has increased 27%.<ref name=""EPA"" /> While some rivers such as the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] have dams to help prevent flooding, other rivers either have no dams or have dams with too little capacity to significantly reduce flooding. Heavy rains have caused the [[Pea River]] to flood [[Elba, Alabama|Elba]] several times, and the [[Alabama River]] flooded two thousand homes in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] and [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] during 1990"".<ref name=""EPA"" />

This uneven rainfall pattern has led to second-order effects, including in the energy sector. ""Droughts... affect the amount of electricity that [[Alabama Power]] and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) can produce from their [[hydroelectric dam]]s, which account for about 8 percent of the electricity produced in the state. During the 2007 drought, total production from the TVA’s hydroelectric plants fell by more than 30 percent, which forced the TVA to meet customer demand by using more expensive fuel-burning power plants"".<ref name=""EPA"" />

Climate change may be affecting the rate of extreme weather events such as tornadoes and tropical storms. The EPA and the [[NOAA]] note that the rate of these events has increased in the last decades, and is expected to increase in the future. However, it remains unclear whether tornado or coastal storm rates have been affected by climate change in particular.<ref name=""EPA""/><ref name=""KCS"">{{cite news|url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article230790399.html|title=‘Here we go again’: Is latest spate of tornadoes a new normal in Missouri and Kansas?|last1=Adler|first1=Eric|date=May 26, 2019|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|last2=Bauer|first2=Laura|last3=Vockrodt|first3=Steve}}</ref>

In July 2019, it was reported that giant [[wasp]] nests, having multiple queens and averaging three to four times the normal size, and sometimes growing as large as a car, were proliferating around the state. This was deemed to be partly due to milder winters in the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/us/alabama-wasp-nest-warning-trnd/index.html|title=Massive wasp nests as big as a car are appearing in Alabama (again)|last=Hughes|first=Mallory|date=July 2, 2019|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

== Climate change policy in Alabama ==
Alabama ranked 15th in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO2 emissions]] in 2016, with 115.7 million metric tons of carbon emitted. Alabama ranked 11th in per capita carbon emissions, at 23.1 metric tons per person. (The state ranked 24th in population in the United States.)
However, overall emissions in Alabama fell 20.6% between 2005 and 2016. This is largely the result of moving away from coal power generation. In 1990, 70% of Alabama’s electricity came from coal. Since 2015, Alabama Power has closed 16 of its 23 coal units. <ref name=""decarbonize2019"">{{cite web |last1=Lyman |first1=Brian |title=Climate and change: How to decarbonize Alabama |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/09/27/climate-change-how-decarbonize-alabama-solar-power-wind-power-carbon-footprint-coal-use-in-alabama/2445288001/ |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |accessdate=19 December 2019 |language=en |date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

Alabama has only minor legislation for clean or renewable energy in 2019, and older, larger programs have been repealed. For instance, Governor [[Fob James]] implemented a 25% tax credit on active solar systems and a 12.5% credit on passive systems in 1981, but this law has since been repealed. Similarly, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) at one point provided solar subsidies in northern Alabama as consumer incentives through its Green Power Providers program, but the TVA plans to end the program in late 2019. Solar and alternative energy providers and consumers find even the minor initiatives ineffective or perverse. The tax increase signed by Governor [[Kay Ivey]] added a $200 tax to electric vehicles and a $100 tax to plug-ins, nominally to support public installation of plug-in stations. However, the low number of such vehicles in Alabama (<1200) means that this tax fails to provide the capital for a robust program. This leads some drivers to see that part of the gas bill as purely punitive. <ref name=""decarbonize2019"" /> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=John |title=Electric and hybrid vehicle fees spur debate |url=https://www.al.com/news/2019/03/unfair-tax-or-fair-share-new-fees-for-electric-and-hybrid-vehicles-prompt-debate-in-alabama.html |website=Advance Local |accessdate=20 December 2019 |language=en |date=8 March 2019}}</ref>

Some state agencies and projects do not take climate projects into account in their activities. This is the case for [[EPA]] planning in Alabama, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office warns that this lack of consideration increases risk to superfund sites.<ref name=""Superfund"" />

==Paleoclimatological evidence==
[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatological]] studies indicate that the last 150 years of California's history have been unusually wet compared to the previous 2000 years. Tree stumps found at the bottom of lakes and rivers in California indicate that many water features dried up during historical dry periods, allowing trees to grow there while the water was absent. These dry periods were associated with warm periods in Earth's history. During the [[Medieval Warm Period]], there were at least two century-long [[megadrought]]s with only 60-70% of modern precipitation levels. Paleoclimatologists believe that higher temperatures due to global warming may cause California to enter another dry period, with significantly lower precipitation and snowpack levels than observed over the last 150 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate change and paleoclimatology: Putting California's drought in a long-term perspective|website=Maven's Notebook|url=https://mavensnotebook.com/2014/11/03/paleoclimate/|date=November 3, 2014|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, a study projected that the single largest threat to Los Angeles County hospitals related to climate change is the direct impact of the expected increase in wildfires. In Los Angeles County, 34% of hospitals are located within one mile of fire hazard severity zones. Additionally, one of these hospitals was also deemed in danger of [[coastal flooding]] due to the effects of climate change as concluded by the study. This latter issue was also included and focused on, as the study likewise concluded that this would become a greater hazard as [[sea level rise]] due to increase annual temperatures.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Adelaine|first1=Sabrina A. |last2=Sato |first2=Mizuki|last3=Jin|first3=Yufang|last4=Godwin|first4=Hilary|author-link4=Hilary Godwin|date=October 2017|title=An Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Los Angeles (California USA) Hospitals, Wildfires Highest Priority|journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine|volume=32|issue=5|pages=556–562|doi=10.1017/S1049023X17006586|issn=1945-1938|pmid=28606202|s2cid=10646762 }}</ref>

As a consequence of further global warming, it is projected that there will be an increase in risk due to climate-driven wildfires in the coming decades.{{by whom|date=July 2021}} Because of warming, frequent droughts, and the legacy of past land management and expansion of residential areas, both people and the ecology are more vulnerable to wildfires. Wildfire activity is closely tied to temperature and drought over time. Globally, the length of the fire season increased by nearly 19% from 1979 to 2013, with significantly longer seasons in the western states. Since 1985, more than 50% of the wildfire area burned in the western United States can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. In addition, due to human fire suppression methods, there is a build of fuels in some ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to wildfires. There is greater risk of fires occurring in denser, dryer forests, where historically these fires have occurred in low-density areas. Lastly, with increases in human population, communities have expanded into areas that are at higher risk to wildfire threat, making these same populations more vulnerable to structural damage and death due to wildfires. Since 1990, the average annual number of homes lost to wildfires has increased by 300%. Almost 900,000 of western US residences were in high risk wildfire areas as of 2017 with nearly 35% of wildfires in California starting within these high risk areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1-link=Tania Schoennagel|last1=Schoennagel|first1=Tania|last2=Balch|first2=Jennifer K.|author-link2=Jennifer Balch|last3=Brenkert-Smith|first3=Hannah|last4=Dennison|first4=Philip E.|last5=Harvey|first5=Brian J.|last6=Krawchuk|first6=Meg A.|last7=Mietkiewicz|first7=Nathan|last8=Morgan|first8=Penelope|last9=Moritz|first9=Max A.|date=2017-05-02|title=Adapt to more wildfire in western North American forests as climate changes|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=18|pages=4582–4590|doi=10.1073/pnas.1617464114|pmid=28416662|pmc=5422781|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2019, after ""red flag"" warning about the possibility of wildfires was declared in some areas of California, the electricity company ""Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)"" begun to shut down power, for preventing inflammation of trees that touch the electricity lines.

According to the NOAA Drought Task Force report of 2014, the drought is not part of a long-term change in precipitation and was a symptom of the natural variability, although the record-high temperature that accompanied the recent drought may have been amplified due to human-induced global warming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpo.noaa.gov/ClimatePrograms/ModelingAnalysisPredictionsandProjections/MAPPTaskForces/DroughtTaskForce/CaliforniaDrought.aspx |title=Archived copy |website=cpo.noaa.gov |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216233908/http://cpo.noaa.gov/ClimatePrograms/ModelingAnalysisPredictionsandProjections/MAPPTaskForces/DroughtTaskForce/CaliforniaDrought.aspx |archive-date=16 December 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This was confirmed by a 2015 scientific study which estimated that global warming ""accounted for 8–27% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012–2014...

In February 2014, the Californian drought effects caused the [[California Department of Water Resources]] to develop plans for a temporary reduction of water allocations to farmland by up to 50% at the time. During that period California's 38 million residents experienced 13 consecutive months of drought.

=== Heat waves ===
From May to September 1999 – 2003, a study was conducted in nine Californian counties that found that for every 10&nbsp;°F (5.6&nbsp;°C) increase in
temperature, there is a 2.6 percent increase in cardiovascular deaths.<ref>Basu, R., and B. D. Ostro. 2008. “A Multicounty Analysis

==== 2006 heat wave ====
A study of the 2006 Californian heat wave showed an increase of 16,166 emergency room visits, and 1,182 hospitalizations. There was also a dramatic increase in heat related illnesses; a six-fold increase in heat-related emergency room visits, and 10-fold increase in hospitalizations.<ref>Knowlton, K., M.

A study of seven counties impacted by the 2006 heat wave found a 9 percent increase in daily mortality per 10 degrees Fahrenheit change in apparent temperature for all counties combined. This estimate is 3 times greater than the effect estimated for the rest of the warm season. The estimates indicate that actual mortality during the 2006 heat wave was two or three times greater than the initial coroner estimate of 147 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/CEC-500-2009-036/CEC-500-2009-036-D.PDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716010226/http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/CEC-500-2009-036/CEC-500-2009-036-D.PDF |archive-date=July 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

=== Air pollution ===

Research suggests that the majority of air pollution related health effects are caused by ozone (O3) and [[particulates|particulate matter]] (PM). Many other pollutants that are associated with climate change, such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, also have health consequences.<ref>Public health-related impacts of climate change in California.

Climate change may lead to exacerbated air pollution problems. Higher temperatures catalyze chemical interactions between nitrogen
oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight that lead to increases in ambient ozone concentrations in urban areas. A study found that for each 1 degree Celsius (1&nbsp;°C) rise in temperature in the United States, there are an estimated 20–30 excess cancer cases, as well as approximately 1000 (CI: 350–1800) excess air-pollution-associated deaths.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the causal link between carbon dioxide and air pollution mortality|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/V/2007GL031101.pdf|website=Web.stanford.edu|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> About 40 percent of the additional deaths may be due to ozone and the rest to particulate matter annually.

== Economic impacts ==

=== Gross domestic product ===
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that under a business-as-usual scenario, between the years 2025 and 2100, the cost of providing water to the western states in the United States will increase from $200 billion to $950 billion per year, an estimated 0.93–1 percent of the United States' gross domestic product (GDP). Four climate change impacts—hurricane damage, energy costs, real estate losses, and water costs—alone are projected to cost 1.8 percent of the GDP of the United States, or, just under $1.9 trillion in 2008 U.S. dollars by the year 2100.<ref name="":1"">{{cite web|title=The Cost of Climate Change: What We'll Pay if Global Warming Continues Unchecked|publisher=NRDC|location=New York, New York |url=http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/cost/cost.pdf|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>

'''Climate change in Arizona''' encompasses the effects of [[climate change]], attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], in the U.S. state of [[Arizona]].

It has been asserted that Arizona ""will suffer more than most of U.S."" due to climate change.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2017/06/29/study-predicts-rising-heat-deaths-costs-arizona-climate-change/439573001/|title=Arizona will suffer more than most of U.S. as climate changes, study says|first=Brandon|last=Loomis|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=June 30, 2017}}</ref> According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Arizona ""has warmed about two degrees (F) in the last century. Throughout the southwestern United States, [[heat wave]]s are becoming more common, and snow is melting earlier in spring. In the coming decades, changing the climate is likely to decrease the flow of water in the [[Colorado River]], threaten the health of livestock, increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and convert some rangelands to desert"".<ref name=""EPA"">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-az.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for Arizona |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref>

== Environmental impacts ==

===Snowpack===

""As the climate warms, less precipitation falls as snow, and more snow melts during the winter. That decreases [[snowpack]]—the amount of snow that accumulates over the winter. Since the 1950s, the snowpack has been decreasing in Arizona, as well as most mountainous areas in the [[Colorado River Basin]]. Diminishing snowpack can decrease water supplies and shorten the season for skiing and other forms of winter tourism and recreation"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Water availability===

""The changing climate is likely to increase the need for water but reduce the supply. Rising temperatures increase the rate at which water evaporates (or transpires) into the air from soils, plants, and surface waters. Irrigated farmland would thus need more water. But less water is likely to be available, because precipitation is unlikely to increase enough to make up for the additional water lost to evaporation. Annual precipitation has decreased in Arizona during the last century, and it may continue to decrease. So soils are likely to be drier, and periods without rain are likely to become longer, making droughts more severe"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

""The decline in snowpack could further limit the supply of water for some purposes. Mountain snowpacks are natural reservoirs. They collect the snow that falls during winter and release water when the snow melts during spring and summer. Over the past 50 years, the snowpack throughout the Colorado River Basin has been melting earlier in the year (see map on back page). Dams capture most meltwater and retain it for use later in the year. But upstream of these reservoirs, less water is available during droughts for ecosystems, fish, water-based recreation, and landowners who draw water directly from a flowing river"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Wildfires and changing landscapes===

""Higher temperatures and drought are likely to increase the severity, frequency, and extent of wildfires, which could harm property, livelihoods, and human health. On average, more than 2 percent of the land in Arizona has burned per decade since 1984. Wildfire smoke can reduce air quality and increase medical visits for chest pains, respiratory problems, and heart problems"".<ref name=""EPA"" />

""The combination of more fires and drier conditions may expand deserts and otherwise change parts of Arizona’s landscape. Many plants and animals living in arid lands are already near the limits of what they can tolerate. A warmer and drier climate would generally extend the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]] deserts to higher elevations and expand their geographic ranges. In some cases, native vegetation may persist and delay or prevent expansion of the desert. In other cases, fires or livestock grazing may accelerate the conversion of grassland to desert in response to a changing climate. For similar reasons, some forests may change to desert or grassland"".<ref name=""EPA"" />

===Pests===

""Warmer and drier conditions make forests more susceptible to pests. Drought reduces the ability of trees to mount a defense against attacks from pests such as bark beetles, which have infested 100,000 acres in Arizona. Temperature controls the life cycle and winter mortality rates of many pests. With higher winter temperatures, some pests can persist year-round, and new pests and diseases may become established"".<ref name=""EPA"" />

== Economic and social impacts ==

===Agriculture===

""Interdependent systems providing water and energy services are necessary for agriculture. Climate change and increased resource demands are expected to cause frequent and severe strains on these systems. Arizona is especially vulnerable to such strains due to its hot and arid climate"".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berardy|first=Andrew|last2=Chester|first2=Mikhail V.|date=February 2017|title=Climate change vulnerability in the food, energy, and water nexus: concerns for agricultural production in Arizona and its urban export supply|url=https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Faa5e6d|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=035004|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa5e6d|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}</ref> ""Increasing droughts and higher temperatures are likely to affect Arizona's top agricultural products: cattle, dairy, and vegetables. Hot temperatures threaten cows’ health and cause them to eat less, grow more slowly, and produce less milk. Livestock operations could also be impaired by fire, the lack of water, and changes in the landscape from grassland to woody shrubs more typical of a desert. Reduced availability of water would also create challenges for irrigated farms, which account for two-thirds of the water used in the state"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

===Tribal communities===

""Climate change threatens natural resources and public health of tribal communities. Rising temperatures and increasing droughts are likely to decrease the availability of certain fish, hunt, and wild plants on which the Navajo and other tribes have relied for generations. Water may be less available for domestic consumption, especially for those who are not served by either municipal systems or reliable wells, which includes about 30 percent of the people on the [[Navajo Nation]], who must haul water to meet daily needs. Recurring drought and rising temperatures may degrade the land itself. In the Navajo Nation, for example, the [[Great Falls Dune Field]] has advanced almost a mile in the last 60 years, threatening roads, homes, and grazing areas. Extreme heat may also create health problems for those without electricity, including about 40 percent of the people on the Navajo reservation"".<ref name=""EPA""/>

== Adaptation ==
[[File:Phoenix_skyline_Arizona_USA.jpg|alt=alt text|thumb|The outdated infrastructure pictured here in the Phoenix downtown will be undergoing drastic changes geared towards improvements in efficiency.]]
Phoenix's large population and extremely dry climate make the city particularly vulnerable to the threats of drought and extreme heat. However, the city has recently incorporated climate change into current (and future) water management and urban design. And by doing so, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has taken steps to ensure sustainable water supplies and to protect populations that are vulnerable to extreme heat, largely through improving the sustainability and efficiency of communal infrastructure. For example, Phoenix uses renewable surface water supplies and reserves groundwater for use during the instance when extended droughts arise. The city is also creating a task force to redesign the downtown core to minimize the way buildings trap heat and increase local temperatures.<ref name=""EPA3"">EPA. “Climate Impacts and Adaptation Examples in the Southwest.” http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/southwest-adaptation.html.</ref>
